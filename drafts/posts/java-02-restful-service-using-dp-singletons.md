**Implementation of `MainServer` (Singleton Pattern)**

---

**MainServer.java**

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;

import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer;

public class MainServer {
    // Static variable to hold the single instance of MainServer
    private static MainServer instance = null;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside
    private MainServer() {
        // Initialize the server here
        startServer();
    }

    // Public method to provide access to the instance
    public static MainServer getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (MainServer.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new MainServer();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }

    // Method to start the HTTP server
    private void startServer() {
        System.out.println("Starting the HTTP server...");
        try {
            // Create an HTTP server listening on port 8000
            HttpServer server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(8000), 0);
            // Set up a context to handle "/tasks" requests
            server.createContext("/tasks", new TaskRequestHandler());
            // Use the default executor
            server.setExecutor(null);
            // Start the server
            server.start();
            System.out.println("Server started on port 8000");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

**Purpose of `MainServer`:**

The `MainServer` class is responsible for initializing and starting the HTTP server for the application. It ensures that only one instance of the server runs throughout the application's lifecycle by implementing the **Singleton** design pattern.

---

**Singleton Pattern Implementation:**

1. **Private Static Instance Variable:**

   ```java
   private static MainServer instance = null;
   ```

  - Holds the single instance of `MainServer`.
  - Declared `static` so it belongs to the class rather than any object.

2. **Private Constructor:**

   ```java
   private MainServer() {
       // Initialize the server here
       startServer();
   }
   ```

  - The constructor is `private` to prevent instantiation from outside the class.
  - Calls `startServer()` to initialize the server when the instance is created.

3. **Public Static Access Method:**

   ```java
   public static MainServer getInstance() {
       if (instance == null) {
           synchronized (MainServer.class) {
               if (instance == null) {
                   instance = new MainServer();
               }
           }
       }
       return instance;
   }
   ```

  - Provides a global access point to the `MainServer` instance.
  - Uses **double-checked locking** with `synchronized` to ensure thread safety.
  - Checks if `instance` is `null` before creating a new one to avoid unnecessary synchronization after the instance is created.

---

**Server Initialization:**

1. **startServer() Method:**

   ```java
   private void startServer() {
       System.out.println("Starting the HTTP server...");
       try {
           // Create an HTTP server listening on port 8000
           HttpServer server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(8000), 0);
           // Set up a context to handle "/tasks" requests
           server.createContext("/tasks", new TaskRequestHandler());
           // Use the default executor
           server.setExecutor(null);
           // Start the server
           server.start();
           System.out.println("Server started on port 8000");
       } catch (IOException e) {
           e.printStackTrace();
       }
   }
   ```

  - **HttpServer Creation:**
    - Uses Java's built-in `HttpServer` from `com.sun.net.httpserver`.
    - Listens on port `8000`.
  - **Context Setup:**
    - Creates a context for the path `/tasks`.
    - Associates it with a `TaskRequestHandler` (to be implemented separately), which handles incoming HTTP requests to `/tasks`.
  - **Executor Setup:**
    - `server.setExecutor(null);` uses a default executor.
  - **Server Start:**
    - Calls `server.start();` to begin listening for incoming requests.
  - **Exception Handling:**
    - Catches `IOException` and prints the stack trace.

---

**Usage Example:**

To start the server, you would call the `getInstance()` method from your application's entry point.

**Application.java**

```java
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Start the MainServer instance
        MainServer.getInstance();
    }
}
```

- By calling `MainServer.getInstance();`, you ensure that the server is initialized and started.
- Subsequent calls to `getInstance()` will return the same instance, thanks to the Singleton pattern.

---

**Why Singleton Pattern?**

- **Single Instance Guarantee:** Ensures that only one instance of `MainServer` exists, preventing conflicts like multiple servers trying to listen on the same port.
- **Global Access Point:** Provides a way to access the server instance from anywhere in the application if needed.
- **Lazy Initialization:** The instance is created only when it's needed, saving resources if the server is not started immediately.
- **Thread Safety:** The use of `synchronized` and double-checked locking ensures that the Singleton instance is created safely in a multithreaded environment.

---

**Key Points:**

- **Private Constructor:** Prevents external instantiation.
- **Static getInstance() Method:** Controls access to the singleton instance.
- **Thread-Safe Initialization:** Double-checked locking prevents multiple threads from creating multiple instances.
- **Server Setup:**
  - Uses Java's built-in HTTP server for simplicity.
  - Sets up a context for handling `/tasks` endpoint.
  - Starts listening for HTTP requests.

---

**Assumptions and Dependencies:**

- **TaskRequestHandler:**
  - Not implemented here but expected to handle HTTP requests for `/tasks`.
  - Should implement `HttpHandler` from `com.sun.net.httpserver`.
- **Imports:**
  - Necessary imports like `java.io.IOException`, `java.net.InetSocketAddress`, and `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer`.
- **Exception Handling:**
  - In a production environment, you'd have more robust exception handling and possibly logging instead of printing stack traces.

---

**Conclusion:**

The `MainServer` class is a straightforward implementation of the Singleton design pattern applied to a simple HTTP server in Java. It ensures that only one server instance exists and provides a centralized point to manage server operations. By using Java's built-in HTTP server, the implementation remains minimal and focused, aligning with your requirement for simplicity and a limited number of classes.

---

**Next Steps:**

- **Implement TaskRequestHandler:**
  - To handle HTTP requests to `/tasks`, you'll need to implement the `TaskRequestHandler` class.
- **Expand Functionality:**
  - Add additional request handlers for other endpoints as needed.
- **Integrate Other Patterns:**
  - As you proceed, incorporate other design patterns for different components, following the structure outlined in the initial design.
