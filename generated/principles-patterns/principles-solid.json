Martin as part of the SOLID principles,\nunderscores the philosophy that a class should have only one reason to change, embodying a single\nfunctionality or concern. This principle advocates for simplicity and modularity in software design,\nsuggesting that each component or class should be responsible for a specific piece of functionality and\nnothing more. By adhering to SRP, software developers ensure that their systems are more maintainable,\nadaptable, and understandable, minimizing the risk of complex interdependencies and making the system easier\nto debug and enhance over time.\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"Imagine a software system as a bustling city, with each building representing a class within the system. Just\nas every building is designed for a specific purpose - be it a library, a restaurant, or an office - each\nclass in a system should serve a distinct role. The SRP posits that a library should not double as a restaurant,\nnor should an office take on the responsibilities of a gym. This specialization allows for changes to be made\nto one building without the risk of unintended consequences rippling through the city, ensuring that enhancements\nor repairs can be carried out efficiently and effectively.\n"},{"variant":"svg","content":"solid/SeparationOfConcerns"},{"variant":"body1","content":"In this city, the flow of information and tasks between buildings mirrors the interactions within a well-designed\nsoftware system. A request from a citizen (user) is like a call to a Controller - a central hub that directs the\nrequest to the appropriate service, akin to a specialized service building. This building then handles the request,\npossibly consulting with others, like repositories or utility services, each dedicated to a specific aspect of city\nlife. The SRP ensures that these interactions are streamlined and that each building (class) focuses on its primary\nfunction, maintaining order and efficiency.\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"Utility services within this city - be they transportation, sanitation, or communication networks - can be likened\nto utility classes in software. While essential for the city's overall functionality, they operate in the background,\nsupporting the primary functions without overshadowing the dedicated roles of other buildings.

Martin's introduction of the SRP and the broader SOLID principles has significantly influenced how developers\nthink about software architecture, much like the way urban planners meticulously design cities for optimal functionality.\nBy ensuring that each component of a system has a single responsibility, developers can create software that is not only\nresilient and flexible but also a joy to work with and easy to evolve. The SRP, in its essence, teaches the importance\nof keeping systems simple, organized, and focused, allowing for the creation of software that stands the test of time,\njust as well-planned cities endure and thrive through the ages.\n"},{"variant":"references","list":[{"author":"Robert C.

Martin as a cornerstone of the SOLID principles, introduces a\nfoundational concept in software development: systems should be designed to accommodate growth through extension, not\nmodification. This principle suggests that once a class is developed and tested, its core should remain untouched, while any\nevolution or enhancement should be achieved by building upon it, rather than altering its essence. This approach ensures that\nthe original class retains its reliability and functionality, safeguarding against the introduction of new bugs or the need\nfor re-validation through extensive quality assurance processes.\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"Consider the metaphor of a well-established tree in an ever-evolving garden. The tree's roots and trunk provide a stable,\nunchanging foundation, while its branches represent the potential for growth and adaptation. As the seasons change, the tree\nmay sprout new branches or leaves to better capture sunlight or support the ecosystem around it, but the core—the trunk and\nroots—remains steadfast. This natural analogy mirrors the Open/Closed Principle, where the \"tree\" (our class) can extend new\n\"branches\" (features or behaviors) without altering its \"trunk\" (the original, tested code).\n"},{"variant":"svg","content":"solid/OpenClosed"},{"variant":"body1","content":"In the realm of software, a classic illustration of adhering to this principle is the handling of a Shape class designed to\ncalculate perimeters. Initially, the class might cater to a limited set of shapes, calculating each perimeter through a specific\nmethod. According to the Open/Closed Principle, rather than rewriting the Shape class to accommodate new shapes, it is made\nabstract, and new shapes are introduced as subclasses, each implementing their unique method for perimeter calculation. This design\nallows the system to gracefully integrate new shapes without disturbing the existing hierarchy or functionality, akin to adding new\nbranches to the tree without tampering with its trunk.\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"However, not all situations are straightforward. The software landscape is rich and varied, sometimes requiring solutions like\nthe Abstract Factory pattern or strategies that involve interfaces to ensure flexibility and adherence to the Open/Closed Principle.\nThese scenarios underscore the principle's call for foresight and thoughtful design, allowing systems to evolve through extension\nrather than modification, much like the strategic pruning and grafting of branches to support new growth without compromising the\ntree's integrity.\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"Embracing the Open/Closed Principle is akin to planning for a garden that thrives through seasons and years. It encourages developers\nto anticipate change and design systems that are not only resilient but also adaptable, capable of embracing the future without losing\ntheir essence.

According\nto the LSP, one should be able to replace a mythical being with one of its descendants—say, a dragon replaced by a fire dragon—without\ndisrupting the balance of the kingdom. This seamless substitution is akin to ensuring that a square, when introduced into a system expecting a\nrectangle, behaves in a manner consistent with the rectangle's contract, even if its inherent properties suggest a specialized behavior.\n"},{"variant":"svg","content":"solid/LiskovSubstitution"},{"variant":"body1","content":"However, LSP's essence stretches beyond the confines of inheritance and polymorphism, touching on the broader themes of design foresight and\nsystem robustness. Just as a kingdom's harmony relies on the predictable behaviors of its creatures, so too does a software system's reliability\ndepend on the consistent behavior of its components. When modeling a hierarchy—be it of shapes, documents, or mythical creatures—the principle\nadvises caution against straying too far from the parent class's purpose, thus preserving the system's integrity and predictability.\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"The principle's application extends into practical scenarios, such as managing diverse document types within a software system.

The LSP encourages designers to maintain a disciplined approach to inheritance,\nensuring that each subclass genuinely belongs in the hierarchy it's placed in, upholding the system's logical structure and expected behavior.\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"In essence, the Liskov Substitution Principle is a guiding star for designing resilient and reliable object-oriented systems. It compels\ndevelopers to think deeply about the relationships between components, advocating for a design philosophy that emphasizes compatibility,\nreliability, and the seamless interchangeability of classes within a hierarchy.

By\nprioritizing abstractions over concrete implementations, DIP facilitates a design where high-level classes—those responsible for orchestrating\ncomplex logic—do not directly depend on low-level classes—those providing specific utility functions. Instead, both sets of classes interact\nthrough interfaces, ensuring that modifications in detailed operations do not necessitate alterations in the system's overarching logic.\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"Envision a city's water supply system as an analogy for DIP.

Instead of the water authority depending directly on each individual water source—which would be cumbersome and inflexible—the\ncity employs a network of pipes and control mechanisms (the abstractions) that standardize how water is delivered, regardless of its source.
