{"title":"Understanding <i>SOLID</i> Principles <br /> in Software Development","before":[{"variant":"body1","content":"The SOLID principles are a set of design principles in object-oriented programming that enable developers to\ncreate more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. Here's a deeper dive into each of these\nprinciples.\n"}],"accordion":{"Separation of Concerns":[{"variant":"body1","content":"Separation of Concerns (SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, \nsuch that each section addresses a separate concern. A concern is a set of information that affects the code \nof a program. SoC is a method of breaking down a complex problem into more manageable parts, each with a clear, \nspecific responsibility. This principle is fundamental in software engineering and is closely related to the \nconcept of modularity and encapsulation, aiming to make a system more understandable, maintainable, and scalable.\n"},{"variant":"subtitle1","content":"Concept\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"The essence of Separation of Concerns is to organize software so that each part addresses a single concern or \nresponsibility. This organizational strategy reduces complexity by isolating components that perform specific \nfunctions and interact with each other in well-defined ways. The principle is applicable at various levels of \nsoftware development, including architecture design, code structuring, and even database management.\n"},{"variant":"subtitle1","content":"Implementation in Design\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"Implementing SoC in software design often involves identifying the different aspects of the application that \nmay change for different reasons (business logic, user interface, data access logic, etc.) and separating \nthese aspects into different modules or layers. Each layer communicates with the others only through defined \ninterfaces, minimizing direct dependencies.\n"},{"variant":"subtitle1","content":"Example\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"Consider a web application with functionality to display user information and allow the user to update it. \nApplying SoC, we can separate this application into three main layers:\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"<ul>\n  <li>Presentation Layer: Handles all user interface and browser communication logic.<li>\n  <li>Business Logic Layer: Contains logic for user data validation and processing.<li>\n  <li>Data Access Layer: Manages all interactions with the database or data storage system.<li>\n<ul>\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"// Presentation Layer\nfunction updateUserProfileUI(userData) {\n  if (validateUserData(userData)) {\n    updateUserProfile(userData);\n  }\n}\n\n// Business Logic Layer\nfunction validateUserData(userData) {\n  // Perform validation checks\n  return userData && userData.name && userData.email;\n}\n\nfunction updateUserProfile(userData) {\n  // Logic to update user profile\n  saveUserData(userData);\n  console.log('User profile updated');\n}\n\n// Data Access Layer\nfunction saveUserData(userData) {\n  // Code to save user data to a database\n  console.log('User data saved to the database');\n}\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"In this simplified example, each function represents a separate concern: the UI logic is separated from the \nvalidation logic, which is further separated from the data persistence logic. This separation makes it easier \nto maintain and modify the application, such as changing the database or the UI framework, without affecting \nthe other parts of the application.\n"},{"variant":"subtitle1","content":"Conclusion\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"Separation of Concerns is a powerful principle in software engineering, facilitating the development of cleaner, \nmore organized code that is easier to test, maintain, and scale. By diligently applying SoC, developers can \nenhance the flexibility and robustness of their systems, making them more adaptable to change and easier to \ncomprehend.\n"}],"Law of Demeter (Principle of Least Knowledge)":[{"variant":"body1","content":"The Law of Demeter, often referred to as the principle of least knowledge, is a guideline aimed at reducing \ncoupling between components in object-oriented design. It advocates for a model where objects limit their \ninteractions to a closely related set of other objects. According to this principle, a given object should \nonly call methods of the following kinds of objects:\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"<ul>\n  <li>The object itself.</li>\n  <li>Objects passed as a parameter to the method.</li>\n  <li>Any object the method creates or instantiates.</li>\n  <li>Any components (objects) held in instance variables of the object's class.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"The Law of Demeter promotes the design of systems that are more maintainable and understandable by minimizing \nthe depth of interactions between objects, effectively reducing the dependencies within the system.\n"},{"variant":"subtitle1","content":"Concept\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"The essence of the Law of Demeter is to encourage shallow, rather than deep, interactions between objects. It \ndiscourages reaching into an object to access another object's properties or methods (an anti-pattern often \ndescribed as \"train wrecks\" - e.g., anObject.getSomething().getAnotherThing().doSomething()). This principle \nhelps in building a system with loosely coupled components, which in turn makes the system more modular, easier \nto understand, and adaptable to changes.\n"},{"variant":"subtitle1","content":"Implementation in a Design\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"In practice, adhering to the Law of Demeter often involves introducing methods that delegate work to the \ncomponents, rather than directly accessing the components of other objects. This encapsulation allows for \nchanges in the internals of a component without affecting its consumers, as long as the component's \ninterface remains consistent.\n"},{"variant":"subtitle1","content":"Example\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"Consider a shopping cart application where a Customer places an Order containing multiple Items. Applying the \nLaw of Demeter, the Order class should not directly access Item details from the Customer class.\n"},{"variant":"code","content":"class Customer {\n  constructor(name) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.order = new Order();\n  }\n\n  addOrder(order) {\n    this.order = order;\n  }\n\n  calculateOrderTotal() {\n    return this.order.calculateTotal();\n  }\n}\n\nclass Order {\n  constructor() {\n    this.items = [];\n  }\n\n  addItem(item) {\n    this.items.push(item);\n  }\n\n  calculateTotal() {\n    return this.items.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price, 0);\n  }\n}\n\nclass Item {\n  constructor(name, price) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.price = price;\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage\nconst customer = new Customer('John Doe');\nconst order = new Order();\norder.addItem(new Item('Laptop', 1000));\norder.addItem(new Item('Mouse', 25));\ncustomer.addOrder(order);\n\nconsole.log(customer.calculateOrderTotal()); // 1025\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"In this example, the Customer class delegates the responsibility of calculating the total order cost to the \nOrder class, rather than directly interacting with the Item objects within the order. This adherence to the \nLaw of Demeter ensures that changes to the structure or methods of the Order or Item classes would not \nnecessitate changes in the Customer class, as long as the interface for calculating the total remains \nconsistent.\n"},{"variant":"subtitle1","content":"Conclusion\n"},{"variant":"body1","content":"The Law of Demeter is a valuable principle for designing loosely coupled systems, promoting encapsulation, \nand enhancing modularity. By following this principle, developers can create systems that are easier to \nmaintain, extend, and refactor, leading to higher quality and more robust software architecture.\n"}],"Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)":[{"variant":"subtitle1","content":"Overview"},{"variant":"body1","content":"DRY is a fundamental principle in software development that emphasizes the importance of avoiding\nduplication in code.

Then refactor these into functions,\nclasses, or modules that can be reused.\n"},{"variant":"subtitle1","content":"Example"},{"variant":"body1","content":"Suppose you have several functions that validate user input. Instead of repeating the validation logic\nin each function, create a single validateInput function and call it wherever validation is needed.\n"},{"variant":"subtitle1","content":"Conclusion"},{"variant":"body1","content":"Adhering to DRY helps in building a cleaner, more efficient, and error-resistant codebase. It's about\nmaximizing the impact of code changes while minimizing the effort.\n"}],"Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS)":[{"variant":"subtitle1","content":"Overview"},{"variant":"body1","content":"KISS advocates for simplicity in design. It suggests that systems work best if they are kept simple\nrather than made complex. Therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary\ncomplexity should be avoided.\n"},{"variant":"subtitle1","content":"Benefits"},{"variant":"body1","content":"Simpler code is easier to understand, test, and maintain.
