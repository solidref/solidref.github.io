C++ offers both high-level object-oriented programming features and low-level memory manipulation capabilities,\nmaking it suitable for developing operating systems, game engines, desktop apps, and much more. It supports multiple programming paradigms,\nincluding procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming. C++ is known for its efficiency and performance, which is why it's widely used\nin developing applications where performance is critical. Over the years, C++ has evolved significantly with the introduction of the Standard Template Library (STL),\nmodern syntax features, and improvements in performance and usability through its various versions (C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, and the upcoming C++23).\nDespite its steep learning curve, C++ remains a foundational language that is crucial for systems programming, game development, and performance-critical applications.\n"},{"name":"C# (C Sharp)","code":"csharp","ext":"cs","birth":2000,"death":"N/A","inspiredBy":["C++","Java","Delphi","Modula-3"],"inspiring":["Swift","Kotlin"],"description":"C# is a versatile, multi-paradigm programming language developed by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative.\nDesigned to be simple yet powerful, C# is widely used for developing desktop applications, web applications (via ASP.NET),\nand more recently, mobile applications through Xamarin. Since its inception, C# has evolved significantly, with C# 7.0 and\nabove introducing features that enhance the language's functionality and developer productivity. These features include tuples\nfor grouping data, pattern matching for more expressive conditionals, local functions for better encapsulation, and\nasync/await for asynchronous programming. With the introduction of .NET Core and .NET 5+, C# has become a cross-platform\nlanguage, running on Linux and macOS in addition to Windows. C# 8.0 introduced nullable reference types to improve code safety,\nand C# 9.0 introduced records for immutable data structures, making it an attractive choice for modern software development\npractices that emphasize safety, performance, and reliability.\n"},{"name":"Go (Golang)","code":"go","ext":"go","birth":2009,"death":"N/A","inspiredBy":["c","oberon","pascal","limbo","python","alef"],"inspiring":["rust","nim","crystal"],"description":"Go, often referred to as Golang, is an open-source programming language developed at Google.\nIt is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and reliable concurrency handling.
