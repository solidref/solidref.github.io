[{"name":"C# (C Sharp)","code":"csharp","birth":2000,"death":"N/A","inspiredBy":["C++","Java","Delphi","Modula-3"],"inspiring":["Swift","Kotlin"],"description":"C# is a versatile, multi-paradigm programming language developed by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative.\nDesigned to be simple yet powerful, C# is widely used for developing desktop applications, web applications (via ASP.NET),\nand more recently, mobile applications through Xamarin. Since its inception, C# has evolved significantly, with C# 7.0 and\nabove introducing features that enhance the language's functionality and developer productivity. These features include tuples\nfor grouping data, pattern matching for more expressive conditionals, local functions for better encapsulation, and\nasync/await for asynchronous programming. With the introduction of .NET Core and .NET 5+, C# has become a cross-platform\nlanguage, running on Linux and macOS in addition to Windows. C# 8.0 introduced nullable reference types to improve code safety,\nand C# 9.0 introduced records for immutable data structures, making it an attractive choice for modern software development\npractices that emphasize safety, performance, and reliability.\n"},{"name":"Go (Golang)","code":"go","birth":2009,"death":"N/A","inspiredBy":["c","oberon","pascal","limbo","python","alef"],"inspiring":["rust","nim","crystal"],"description":"Go, often referred to as Golang, is an open-source programming language developed at Google.\nIt is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and reliable concurrency handling. Go is statically\ntyped, compiled, and syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection,\nstructural typing, and CSP-style concurrency features. It's widely used in cloud and network\nservices, command-line tools, and web applications. A notable feature of Go is its efficient\nhandling of concurrent operations, making it a popular choice for building high-performance\napplications. Go's design is focused on simplicity and readability, which has led to its wide\nadoption in software engineering for scalable server-side applications. The language has a\nstrong standard library, robust tooling, and a rapidly growing ecosystem.\n"},{"name":"JavaScript (ECMAScript)","code":"javascript","birth":1995,"death":"N/A","inspiredBy":["awk","hypertalk","java","perl","python","self","scheme"],"inspiring":["typescript","coffeescript","dart","elm"],"description":"A key technology of the World Wide Web, JavaScript is an essential language for front-end web development,\nenabling interactive web pages. It's also used in server-side development (Node.js, Deno, and Bun). As a multi-paradigm language,\nit supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has dynamic typing and supports object-oriented programming.\nJavaScript has seen significant evolution since its inception, particularly with the introduction of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) in 2015,\nwhich brought major syntactic improvements and features like classes, modules, arrow functions, and template literals.\n"},{"name":"Python","code":"python","birth":1991,"death":"N/A","inspiredBy":["ABC","C","Haskell","Lisp","Modula-3","Perl"],"inspiring":["Cobra","Groovy","Ruby","Swift","Go"],"description":"Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its emphasis on readability and simplicity.\nWidely used in scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and web development, it supports multiple\nprogramming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python's comprehensive standard\nlibrary, dynamic typing, and ease of learning make it an ideal language for beginners and experienced developers alike.\nSignificant developments in Python's history include the introduction of Python 3 in 2008, which was not backward-compatible\nwith Python 2, leading to a prolonged transition period for many projects. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability\nand the use of whitespace. It has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, with a strong community\nsupporting the development of a vast ecosystem of third-party packages for various applications.\n"},{"name":"TypeScript","code":"typescript","birth":2012,"death":"N/A","inspiredBy":["javascript","c#","java","php","python","ruby","scala"],"inspiring":["javascript"],"description":"TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language.\nIt was developed by Microsoft and is widely used for building large-scale applications,\nparticularly in the realm of web development. TypeScript compiles to plain JavaScript and can be\nused in both front-end and back-end development. It offers features like static typing,\ninterfaces, generics, and advanced tooling support through tools like Visual Studio Code.\nTypeScript provides developers with increased type safety and helps catch errors at compile time,\nleading to more robust and maintainable codebases.\n"}]
