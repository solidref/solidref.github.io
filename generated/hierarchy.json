It's also used in server-side development (Node.js, Deno, and Bun). As a multi-paradigm language,\nit supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has dynamic typing and supports object-oriented programming.\nJavaScript has seen significant evolution since its inception, particularly with the introduction of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) in 2015,\nwhich brought major syntactic improvements and features like classes, modules, arrow functions, and template literals.\n"},{"name":"Go (Golang)","code":"go","birth":2009,"death":"N/A","inspiredBy":["c","oberon","pascal","limbo","python","alef"],"inspiring":["rust","nim","crystal"],"description":"Go, often referred to as Golang, is an open-source programming language developed at Google.\nIt is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and reliable concurrency handling. Go is statically\ntyped, compiled, and syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection,\nstructural typing, and CSP-style concurrency features. It's widely used in cloud and network\nservices, command-line tools, and web applications. A notable feature of Go is its efficient\nhandling of concurrent operations, making it a popular choice for building high-performance\napplications. Go's design is focused on simplicity and readability, which has led to its wide\nadoption in software engineering for scalable server-side applications. The language has a\nstrong standard library, robust tooling, and a rapidly growing ecosystem.\n"},{"name":"TypeScript","code":"typescript","birth":2012,"death":"N/A","inspiredBy":["javascript","c#","java","php","python","ruby","scala"],"inspiring":["javascript"],"description":"TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language.\nIt was developed by Microsoft and is widely used for building large-scale applications,\nparticularly in the realm of web development. TypeScript compiles to plain JavaScript and can be\nused in both front-end and back-end development. It offers features like static typing,\ninterfaces, generics, and advanced tooling support through tools like Visual Studio Code.\nTypeScript provides developers with increased type safety and helps catch errors at compile time,\nleading to more robust and maintainable codebases.\n"}]
