This pattern is particularly useful when we need to enforce consistency across multiple products or components that belong to the same family.\nIntent # The main intent of the Abstract Factory pattern is to encapsulate a group of individual factories with a common interface. This allows clients to create families of related objects without coupling the code to specific implementations. It promotes a more modular and scalable design by allowing the creation of product families independently of the client code.\nProblem and Solution # Problem # Imagine you’re building a cross-platform GUI application that needs different sets of UI components (e.g., buttons, text fields) for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You want the application to remain consistent on each platform but don’t want to hard-code the specifics of each platform in the main application code.\nSolution # The Abstract Factory pattern allows you to define an interface (GUIFactory) that provides methods to create a family of related objects, such as Button and TextField. Each platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) has its own factory implementation that provides platform-specific instances of these components.\nStructure # The Abstract Factory pattern typically includes:\nAbstract Factory Interface: Declares methods for creating abstract product types. Concrete Factories: Implementations of the abstract factory interface that return specific types of products. Abstract Product Interfaces: Interfaces or abstract classes for each type of product created by the factory. Concrete Products: Implementations of the abstract product interfaces. UML Diagram # +-------------------+ +---------------------+ | GUIFactory | | Button | |-------------------| |---------------------| | + createButton() | | + render() | | + createTextField()| |---------------------| +-------------------+ | LinuxButton | | WindowsButton | +---------------------+ Example: Cross-Platform UI Components # Let’s implement a simplified cross-platform UI system with the Abstract Factory pattern in Java. We’ll create an interface GUIFactory that provides factory methods for creating Button and TextField objects. Each platform (Windows and Linux) has its own factory that produces platform-specific components.\nStep 1: Define Abstract Product Interfaces # // Abstract Product for Buttons interface Button { void render(); } // Abstract Product for TextFields interface TextField { void render(); } Step 2: Define Concrete Products # // Concrete Button for Windows class WindowsButton implements Button { public void render() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Rendering Windows Button\u0026#34;); } } // Concrete TextField for Windows class WindowsTextField implements TextField { public void render() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Rendering Windows TextField\u0026#34;); } } // Concrete Button for Linux class LinuxButton implements Button { public void render() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Rendering Linux Button\u0026#34;); } } // Concrete TextField for Linux class LinuxTextField implements TextField { public void render() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Rendering Linux TextField\u0026#34;); } Step 3: Define the Abstract Factory Interface # // Abstract Factory interface GUIFactory { Button createButton(); TextField createTextField(); } Step 4: Implement Concrete Factories # // Concrete Factory for Windows class WindowsFactory implements GUIFactory { public Button createButton() { return new WindowsButton(); } public TextField createTextField() { return new WindowsTextField(); } } // Concrete Factory for Linux class LinuxFactory implements GUIFactory { public Button createButton() { return new LinuxButton(); } public TextField createTextField() { return new LinuxTextField(); } } Step 5: Client Code # The client code uses the factory to create objects without needing to know about specific implementations. This makes it easy to switch between different families of products.\nclass Application { private Button button; private TextField textField; public Application(GUIFactory factory) { button = factory.createButton(); textField = factory.createTextField(); } public void renderUI() { button.render(); textField.render(); } } // Client code public class Client { public static void main(String[] args) { GUIFactory factory; String os = System.getProperty(\u0026#34;os.name\u0026#34;); if (os.contains(\u0026#34;Windows\u0026#34;)) { factory = new WindowsFactory(); } else { factory = new LinuxFactory(); } Application app = new Application(factory); app.renderUI(); } } Explanation # In this example:\nApplication depends on the GUIFactory interface, not specific implementations, which adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle. We can easily switch between different platforms by providing different factory implementations (e.g., WindowsFactory or LinuxFactory) without changing Application’s code. This design makes the system open for extension but closed for modification, aligning with the Open-Closed Principle. Applicability # Use the Abstract Factory pattern when:\nYou need to create families of related objects, such as UI components that should be consistent across an application. You want to isolate the client code from concrete implementations and enforce consistency among related objects. Your application needs to be scalable with minimal modification to existing code. Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Encapsulates Object Creation: Abstract Factory centralizes object creation, making the code more organized and easier to manage. Promotes Consistency: Ensures that related products are consistent and can work together. Improves Scalability: Adding new product families requires only creating new factory implementations, without altering existing code. Disadvantages # Increased Complexity: Using multiple interfaces and classes can make the code more complex, especially for small projects. Limited Flexibility with Families: Each concrete factory produces a specific family of products, so adding new products outside of existing families may require additional modifications. Summary # The Abstract Factory pattern is a powerful tool for creating families of related objects in a consistent and scalable way. By encapsulating object creation and enforcing consistent product families, this pattern helps decouple the client code from specific implementations, making the system more modular and adaptable to change.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/design-patterns/adapter/","title":"Adapter Pattern","section":"Design Patterns","content":" Adapter Pattern # The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that enables objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of a class into another interface that the client expects. This pattern is useful when integrating components that were not designed to work together.\nIntent # The main intent of the Adapter pattern is to allow classes with incompatible interfaces to communicate by providing a wrapper that adapts one interface to another. This pattern lets developers reuse existing code with new systems without modifying the original codebase.\nProblem and Solution # Problem # Suppose you are building a payment processing system that needs to integrate with multiple third-party payment providers. Each provider has its own API with a unique set of methods and parameter structures. This incompatibility makes it difficult to switch between providers or support multiple providers simultaneously.\nSolution # The Adapter pattern addresses this by creating a common interface that the application can use for all payment providers. Each provider then has its own adapter that implements the common interface and translates calls to the third-party provider’s API.\nStructure # The Adapter pattern typically includes:\nTarget Interface: Defines the interface expected by the client. Adapter Class: Implements the target interface and wraps an adaptee, translating calls from the target to the adaptee. Adaptee: The class with an incompatible interface that needs to be adapted. UML Diagram # +--------------------+ +--------------------+ | Target | | Adaptee | |------------------- | |--------------------| | + request() | | + specificRequest()| +--------------------+ +--------------------+ ^ ^ | | +--------------------------+ Adapter Example: Payment Processing System # Let’s implement an example of integrating different payment providers using the Adapter pattern. We’ll create a common PaymentProcessor interface that each provider’s adapter will implement, allowing the application to interact with various payment providers in a uniform way.\nStep 1: Define the Target Interface # The PaymentProcessor interface defines the method that the client expects to use for processing payments.\n// Target Interface interface PaymentProcessor { void processPayment(double amount); } Step 2: Define the Adaptees # Each payment provider has its own interface, which is incompatible with the PaymentProcessor interface. Here are two example providers, Stripe and PayPal.\n// Adaptee 1: Stripe Payment API class StripePayment { public void makeStripePayment(double amount) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Processing payment with Stripe: $\u0026#34; + amount); } } // Adaptee 2: PayPal Payment API class PayPalPayment { public void sendPayment(double amount) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Processing payment with PayPal: $\u0026#34; + amount); } } Step 3: Create Adapter Classes # The StripeAdapter and PayPalAdapter classes implement the PaymentProcessor interface, allowing the client to use these adapters interchangeably. Each adapter translates the processPayment call to the appropriate method in the adaptee.\n// Adapter for Stripe class StripeAdapter implements PaymentProcessor { private StripePayment stripePayment; public StripeAdapter(StripePayment stripePayment) { this.stripePayment = stripePayment; } @Override public void processPayment(double amount) { stripePayment.makeStripePayment(amount); } } // Adapter for PayPal class PayPalAdapter implements PaymentProcessor { private PayPalPayment payPalPayment; public PayPalAdapter(PayPalPayment payPalPayment) { this.payPalPayment = payPalPayment; } @Override public void processPayment(double amount) { payPalPayment.sendPayment(amount); } } Step 4: Client Code Using the Adapter # The client code interacts with the PaymentProcessor interface, allowing it to process payments through different providers without being aware of their specific implementations.\npublic class Client { public static void main(String[] args) { PaymentProcessor stripeProcessor = new StripeAdapter(new StripePayment()); stripeProcessor.processPayment(50.0); // Output: Processing payment with Stripe: $50.0 PaymentProcessor payPalProcessor = new PayPalAdapter(new PayPalPayment()); payPalProcessor.processPayment(75.0); // Output: Processing payment with PayPal: $75.0 } } Explanation # In this example:\nThe PaymentProcessor interface is the target interface that the client expects. Each adapter (StripeAdapter and PayPalAdapter) adapts the incompatible interfaces (StripePayment and PayPalPayment) to the PaymentProcessor interface. The client code can process payments using any payment provider without knowing the specific details of each provider’s API. Applicability # Use the Adapter pattern when:\nYou want to integrate classes with incompatible interfaces. You need to reuse existing classes in a system that requires a specific interface. You need to work with a third-party library or legacy system whose interface cannot be modified. Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Increased Reusability: Adapter allows existing classes to be reused in new contexts without modification. Decouples Code: The client code is decoupled from specific implementations, making it easier to switch between different implementations. Improved Flexibility: The pattern enables seamless integration of components that were not originally designed to work together. Disadvantages # Increased Complexity: The Adapter pattern introduces an additional layer, which can increase code complexity. Potential Overhead: In some cases, adapting an interface may add slight performance overhead, especially if many adapters are involved. Best Practices for Implementing the Adapter Pattern # Use Composition Over Inheritance: Adapters are often implemented using composition (holding an instance of the adaptee) rather than inheritance, making them more flexible. Apply Adapter to External or Legacy Systems: The Adapter pattern is particularly useful when dealing with third-party APIs or legacy code. Avoid Overusing: If classes are already compatible or can be made compatible with minor modifications, consider simpler integration strategies instead. Conclusion # The Adapter pattern is a powerful way to bridge incompatible interfaces, allowing for more flexible and reusable code. By using adapters, you can integrate legacy or third-party code seamlessly into new systems, facilitating modularity and adaptability.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/design-patterns/bridge/","title":"Bridge Pattern","section":"Design Patterns","content":" Bridge Pattern # The Bridge pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently. This pattern enables flexibility by creating two separate hierarchies: one for abstractions and another for implementations, with a bridge connecting them.\nIntent # The main intent of the Bridge pattern is to separate an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can evolve independently. This pattern is particularly useful when there are multiple ways to implement an abstraction, as it prevents tight coupling between the abstraction and its concrete implementations.\nProblem and Solution # Problem # Suppose you are building a graphics rendering system that can render different types of shapes (e.g., Circle, Square) in different modes (e.g., Vector, Raster). Without the Bridge pattern, you would need to create a separate class for each combination of shape and rendering type (e.g., VectorCircle, RasterCircle, VectorSquare, RasterSquare). This can lead to a proliferation of classes that are difficult to maintain and extend.\nSolution # The Bridge pattern solves this problem by separating the Shape abstraction from the Rendering implementation. Each shape can hold a reference to a rendering object and delegate the rendering process to it. This way, adding a new rendering type or a new shape type only requires creating a new class in the appropriate hierarchy, rather than multiplying the combinations.\nStructure # The Bridge pattern typically includes:\nAbstraction: Defines the high-level interface and holds a reference to an implementor. Refined Abstraction: A subclass of the abstraction that adds specific functionality. Implementor: Defines the interface for the implementation classes. Concrete Implementors: Concrete classes that implement the implementor interface, providing specific implementations.

We’ll separate the shape abstraction from the rendering implementation, enabling different types of shapes to be rendered in various ways (e.g., Vector or Raster).\nStep 1: Define the Implementor Interface # The Renderer interface defines the methods that concrete rendering classes must implement. These methods perform the actual rendering work.\n// Implementor Interface interface Renderer { void renderCircle(int radius); void renderSquare(int side); } Step 2: Implement Concrete Implementors # Each concrete implementor provides a specific rendering method (e.g., Vector rendering or Raster rendering).\n// Concrete Implementor for Vector Rendering class VectorRenderer implements Renderer { public void renderCircle(int radius) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Rendering circle in vector mode with radius \u0026#34; + radius); } public void renderSquare(int side) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Rendering square in vector mode with side \u0026#34; + side); } } // Concrete Implementor for Raster Rendering class RasterRenderer implements Renderer { public void renderCircle(int radius) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Rendering circle in raster mode with radius \u0026#34; + radius); } public void renderSquare(int side) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Rendering square in raster mode with side \u0026#34; + side); } } Step 3: Define the Abstraction # The Shape abstraction holds a reference to a Renderer object, which is used to delegate the rendering work. This decouples Shape from the specific rendering implementations.\n// Abstraction abstract class Shape { protected Renderer renderer; public Shape(Renderer renderer) { this.renderer = renderer; } public abstract void draw(); } Step 4: Implement Refined Abstractions # Each concrete shape (e.g., Circle, Square) extends Shape and uses the renderer to perform the drawing.\n// Refined Abstraction for Circle class Circle extends Shape { private int radius; public Circle(Renderer renderer, int radius) { super(renderer); this.radius = radius; } public void draw() { renderer.renderCircle(radius); } } // Refined Abstraction for Square class Square extends Shape { private int side; public Square(Renderer renderer, int side) { super(renderer); this.side = side; } public void draw() { renderer.renderSquare(side); } } Step 5: Client Code Using the Bridge # The client code can create any shape with any renderer, enabling flexible combinations without modifying existing classes.\npublic class Client { public static void main(String[] args) { Renderer vectorRenderer = new VectorRenderer(); Renderer rasterRenderer = new RasterRenderer(); Shape circle = new Circle(vectorRenderer, 5); Shape square = new Square(rasterRenderer, 10); circle.draw(); // Output: Rendering circle in vector mode with radius 5 square.draw(); // Output: Rendering square in raster mode with side 10 } } Explanation # In this example:\nThe Shape class is the abstraction, while Circle and Square are refined abstractions. Renderer is the implementor interface, and VectorRenderer and RasterRenderer are concrete implementors. The draw method in Shape calls the rendering methods in Renderer, allowing Shape to vary independently of its rendering implementation. Applicability # Use the Bridge pattern when:\nYou need to separate an abstraction from its implementation to allow both to vary independently. You have multiple hierarchies (e.g., shapes and rendering methods) that you want to manage without creating a class for each combination. You want to avoid a \u0026ldquo;class explosion\u0026rdquo; where too many concrete classes are created to handle all combinations of abstractions and implementations. Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Enhanced Flexibility: The Bridge pattern decouples abstraction from implementation, making it easier to modify or extend each independently. Reduced Class Explosion: The pattern prevents the proliferation of classes, which would occur if each abstraction had to implement every possible implementation. Improved Scalability: New abstractions and implementations can be added independently, allowing the system to grow without major modifications. Disadvantages # Increased Complexity: The Bridge pattern introduces additional classes, which may add complexity, especially for simpler systems. Not Always Necessary: For scenarios where abstraction and implementation do not need to vary independently, the Bridge pattern may be overkill. Best Practices for Implementing the Bridge Pattern # Use Composition Over Inheritance: The Bridge pattern emphasizes composition, with abstractions containing references to implementations, rather than using inheritance. Identify Independent Hierarchies: Ensure that the abstraction and implementation are truly independent and likely to vary separately before applying the Bridge pattern. Limit Complexity in Simple Cases: If abstraction and implementation do not vary frequently, consider simpler solutions to avoid overengineering. Conclusion # The Bridge pattern provides a structured way to separate abstraction from implementation, enhancing modularity and scalability. By decoupling the two hierarchies, this pattern enables flexible combinations and minimizes dependencies, making it easier to adapt the system to new requirements.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/design-patterns/builder/","title":"Builder Pattern","section":"Design Patterns","content":" Builder Pattern # The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to construct complex objects step by step. It provides a flexible solution to create various representations of an object without complicating the main constructor. This pattern is especially helpful when an object has many optional or configurable properties.\nIntent # The main intent of the Builder pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, enabling the creation of different representations through a single process. This pattern simplifies the process of creating objects with numerous configurations, providing a structured way to build objects with optional parameters.\nProblem and Solution # Problem # Suppose you’re creating a House object that can have multiple configurable components, like windows, doors, floors, and a roof. Using a constructor with numerous parameters can quickly become unreadable and prone to errors, especially if many parameters are optional.\nSolution # The Builder pattern lets you create a HouseBuilder class that builds House objects step by step, only including the properties needed for each particular instance. This approach is more readable and manageable, as it clearly defines each part of the construction.\nStructure # The Builder pattern typically includes:\nBuilder Interface: Declares methods to set each attribute or part of the complex object. Concrete Builder: Implements the builder interface, constructing and assembling parts of the product. Product: The complex object being built. Director (optional): Oversees the construction process, ensuring the correct order or steps are followed to create the final object.

The HouseBuilder class allows us to construct different house configurations without using a long list of parameters.\nStep 1: Define the Product # The product class House represents the final object we want to build.\nclass House { private int windows; private int doors; private int floors; private String roofType; public House(int windows, int doors, int floors, String roofType) { this.windows = windows; this.doors = doors; this.floors = floors; this.roofType = roofType; } @Override public String toString() { return \u0026#34;House with \u0026#34; + windows + \u0026#34; windows, \u0026#34; + doors + \u0026#34; doors, \u0026#34; + floors + \u0026#34; floors, and a \u0026#34; + roofType + \u0026#34; roof.\u0026#34;; } } Step 2: Define the Builder Interface # The builder interface HouseBuilder defines the methods required to build each part of a House.\ninterface HouseBuilder { HouseBuilder setWindows(int windows); HouseBuilder setDoors(int doors); HouseBuilder setFloors(int floors); HouseBuilder setRoofType(String roofType); House build(); } Step 3: Implement the Concrete Builder # The concrete builder class ConcreteHouseBuilder implements the HouseBuilder interface and provides methods to set each attribute.\nclass ConcreteHouseBuilder implements HouseBuilder { private int windows; private int doors; private int floors; private String roofType; @Override public HouseBuilder setWindows(int windows) { this.windows = windows; return this; } @Override public HouseBuilder setDoors(int doors) { this.doors = doors; return this; } @Override public HouseBuilder setFloors(int floors) { this.floors = floors; return this; } @Override public HouseBuilder setRoofType(String roofType) { this.roofType = roofType; return this; } @Override public House build() { return new House(windows, doors, floors, roofType); } } Step 4: Using the Builder in Client Code # The client code uses the builder to construct different configurations of a House without needing to modify the House class directly.\npublic class Client { public static void main(String[] args) { HouseBuilder builder = new ConcreteHouseBuilder(); // Building a simple house House simpleHouse = builder .setWindows(4) .setDoors(2) .setFloors(1) .setRoofType(\u0026#34;Gable\u0026#34;) .build(); System.out.println(simpleHouse); // Building a complex house House complexHouse = builder .setWindows(10) .setDoors(5) .setFloors(3) .setRoofType(\u0026#34;Hip\u0026#34;) .build(); System.out.println(complexHouse); } } Output # House with 4 windows, 2 doors, 1 floors, and a Gable roof. House with 10 windows, 5 doors, 3 floors, and a Hip roof. In this example:\nThe HouseBuilder interface defines methods for setting each property of the House. ConcreteHouseBuilder implements the HouseBuilder interface, allowing properties to be set one by one. The client can build House objects with different configurations, such as a single-story house or a complex multi-story house, without modifying the House class directly. Applicability # Use the Builder pattern when:\nYou need to create complex objects with multiple configurations or optional parts. You want to avoid using a long list of constructor parameters. You need a way to construct objects with clear, step-by-step instructions. Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Increased Readability: Builders provide a more readable way to construct complex objects, with each attribute clearly defined. Flexibility in Object Creation: The Builder pattern allows different configurations of an object without modifying its structure. Immutability: Once a product is built, it can be made immutable, ensuring consistent state across the application. Disadvantages # Increased Complexity: The Builder pattern introduces additional classes, which can increase complexity, especially in simpler scenarios. Limited Use for Simple Objects: If an object has only a few attributes or doesn’t require multiple configurations, the Builder pattern may be unnecessary. Best Practices for Implementing the Builder Pattern # Use Fluent Interfaces: Design builder methods to return the builder object itself, allowing for method chaining and improved readability. Use Director Class (Optional): When building complex products with specific construction steps, consider adding a Director class to manage the sequence and enforce rules for object construction. Consider Inner Builder Classes: In languages like Java, it’s common to use an inner static Builder class to simplify the structure when the Builder is tightly coupled to the product. Conclusion # The Builder pattern provides a structured approach for constructing complex objects with multiple configurations, avoiding bloated constructors and improving code readability. By separating the construction process from the representation, the Builder pattern allows for a modular, flexible, and maintainable design, especially useful when creating objects with optional or numerous properties.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility/","title":"Chain of Responsibility Pattern","section":"Design Patterns","content":" Chain of Responsibility Pattern # The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows a request to be passed along a chain of handlers.

This pattern provides a flexible approach to handling requests, especially when multiple handlers are available.\nIntent # The main intent of the Chain of Responsibility pattern is to decouple the sender of a request from its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. The pattern creates a chain of handlers, where each handler has the opportunity to process the request or pass it along the chain.\nProblem and Solution # Problem # Suppose you’re designing a system for processing user support requests. Depending on the type of request, it may need to be handled by different levels of support staff (e.g., Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3).

If a request’s priority is within the handler’s threshold, it processes the request; otherwise, it forwards it to the next handler.\n// Concrete Handler for Level 1 Support class Level1Support extends SupportHandler { @Override public void handleRequest(String request, int priority) { if (priority \u0026lt;= 1) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Level 1 Support: Handling request \u0026#39;\u0026#34; + request + \u0026#34;\u0026#39;\u0026#34;); } else if (nextHandler != null) { nextHandler.handleRequest(request, priority); } } } // Concrete Handler for Level 2 Support class Level2Support extends SupportHandler { @Override public void handleRequest(String request, int priority) { if (priority \u0026lt;= 2) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Level 2 Support: Handling request \u0026#39;\u0026#34; + request + \u0026#34;\u0026#39;\u0026#34;); } else if (nextHandler != null) { nextHandler.handleRequest(request, priority); } } } // Concrete Handler for Level 3 Support class Level3Support extends SupportHandler { @Override public void handleRequest(String request, int priority) { if (priority \u0026lt;= 3) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Level 3 Support: Handling request \u0026#39;\u0026#34; + request + \u0026#34;\u0026#39;\u0026#34;); } else { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Request \u0026#39;\u0026#34; + request + \u0026#34;\u0026#39; cannot be handled.\u0026#34;); } } } Step 3: Client Code Using the Chain of Responsibility # The client code creates a chain of support levels and submits requests to the first handler in the chain.\npublic class Client { public static void main(String[] args) { // Create support levels SupportHandler level1 = new Level1Support(); SupportHandler level2 = new Level2Support(); SupportHandler level3 = new Level3Support(); // Set up the chain of responsibility level1.setNext(level2); level2.setNext(level3); // Send requests with varying priorities System.out.println(\u0026#34;Processing requests:\u0026#34;); level1.handleRequest(\u0026#34;Basic issue\u0026#34;, 1); // Handled by Level 1 level1.handleRequest(\u0026#34;Intermediate issue\u0026#34;, 2); // Handled by Level 2 level1.handleRequest(\u0026#34;Complex issue\u0026#34;, 3); // Handled by Level 3 level1.handleRequest(\u0026#34;Critical issue\u0026#34;, 4); // Cannot be handled } } Output # Processing requests: Level 1 Support: Handling request \u0026#39;Basic issue\u0026#39; Level 2 Support: Handling request \u0026#39;Intermediate issue\u0026#39; Level 3 Support: Handling request \u0026#39;Complex issue\u0026#39; Request \u0026#39;Critical issue\u0026#39; cannot be handled. In this example:\nSupportHandler is the handler interface that defines handleRequest. Level1Support, Level2Support, and Level3Support are concrete handlers that process requests based on priority. The client creates a chain by setting the nextHandler for each support level and submits requests to the first handler in the chain. Applicability # Use the Chain of Responsibility pattern when:\nMultiple objects can handle a request, and the handler is determined dynamically. You want to decouple the sender from the receiver by allowing more than one handler for a request. You need to implement multiple handlers with similar interfaces or shared responsibilities. Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Reduced Coupling: Chain of Responsibility decouples the sender from the receiver, promoting a more flexible and scalable system. Dynamic Request Processing: Handlers can be added, removed, or rearranged at runtime, enabling dynamic request processing. Single Responsibility Principle: Each handler focuses on a specific responsibility, making the code easier to maintain and extend. Disadvantages # Uncertain Request Handling: There’s no guarantee that a request will be handled if it doesn’t match any handler in the chain. Potential Performance Overhead: If the chain is long, a request may need to pass through multiple handlers, which can lead to performance overhead. Complexity with Long Chains: Managing long chains or complex sequences of handlers can make debugging and tracking requests challenging. Best Practices for Implementing the Chain of Responsibility Pattern # Ensure Chain Order: The order of handlers in the chain can affect how requests are processed, so arrange handlers carefully. Use Null Object for End of Chain: Consider using a null object to represent the end of the chain, eliminating the need for null checks. Avoid Long Chains: Keep chains manageable, as long chains can lead to performance issues and complex code. Conclusion # The Chain of Responsibility pattern provides a flexible approach to handling requests, allowing multiple objects to process a request independently. This pattern is highly beneficial when multiple handlers could potentially handle a request, and it supports easy extension and modification by adding or rearranging handlers.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/docs/clean-code/","title":"Clean Code","section":"Docs","content":"Clean code is not just about making code work; it’s about making code readable, maintainable, and adaptable. Writing clean code allows for easier collaboration, faster debugging, and more robust applications. Below are some essential principles of clean code, along with examples and explanations.\nMeaningful Names # Choose variable, function, and class names that clearly indicate their purpose. Avoid abbreviations and single letters unless they are common conventions (e.g., i for a loop index).\nExample # # Bad def calc(x, y): return x + y # Good def calculate_total_price(price, tax): return price + tax Using meaningful names improves code readability and minimizes the need for comments.\nSmall Functions and Methods # Functions should do one thing and do it well. Keeping functions small and focused makes code easier to test, reuse, and debug.\nExample # // Bad function processOrder(order) { validate(order); calculatePrice(order); saveOrder(order); sendConfirmation(order); } // Good function validateOrder(order) { /* ... */ } function calculateOrderPrice(order) { /* ... */ } function saveOrder(order) { /* ... */ } function sendOrderConfirmation(order) { /* ... */ } Each function has a single responsibility, making the code modular and easier to manage.\nAvoiding Magic Numbers and Strings # Avoid using hard-coded numbers or strings directly in your code. Instead, assign them to constants with meaningful names.\nExample # // Bad if (user.age \u0026gt; 18) { /* ... */ } // Good final int LEGAL_AGE = 18; if (user.age \u0026gt; LEGAL_AGE) { /* ... */ } This practice makes your code self-explanatory and simplifies updates if the value needs to change.\nSingle Responsibility Principle # Each function, method, or class should have only one reason to change. Following this principle leads to better organized, modular code.\nExample # # Bad class UserAccount def create_account # ... end def send_welcome_email # ... end end # Good class UserAccount def create_account # ... end end class EmailService def send_welcome_email # ... end end Separating responsibilities promotes code reuse and easier maintenance.\nComment with Purpose # Comments should explain the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; behind complex logic, not the \u0026ldquo;what.\u0026rdquo; If the code is self-explanatory, additional comments may be unnecessary.\nExample # // Bad int age = 18; // setting age to 18 // Good // Minimum age requirement for registration int minimumAge = 18; Consistent Coding Style # Consistent formatting and naming conventions make code easier to read and navigate. Most languages have widely accepted conventions, so try to follow them or establish team guidelines.\nDRY Principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself) # Avoid duplicating code. Instead, encapsulate common logic in functions or methods. Duplication increases maintenance costs and introduces inconsistencies.\nExample # // Bad $discount = $price * 0.10; $total = $price - $discount; // Good function calculateDiscount($price, $rate) { return $price * $rate; } $discount = calculateDiscount($price, 0.10); $total = $price - $discount; Error Handling # Handle errors gracefully to prevent application crashes and improve the user experience. Make use of error codes, exceptions, and logging where appropriate.\nExample # // Bad function fetchData(url) { const response = fetch(url); return response.json(); } // Good async function fetchData(url) { try { const response = await fetch(url); return await response.json(); } catch (error) { console.error(\u0026#34;Error fetching data:\u0026#34;, error); } } Write Tests # Testing is essential for clean code. Tests help catch bugs early and ensure that changes don’t break existing functionality.\nExample # // Using a testing framework like Jest test(\u0026#34;calculateTotalPrice adds price and tax\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; { expect(calculateTotalPrice(100, 20)).toBe(120); }); Refactor Continuously # Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior.

These principles go beyond syntax, offering best practices that can be applied across programming languages. Here are some core coding principles that every developer should know.\nDRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) # The DRY principle encourages avoiding duplication in code. Instead of repeating similar logic in multiple places, encapsulate it in a function or module. This reduces redundancy, minimizes potential errors, and makes updates easier.\n# Bad def calculate_discount(price): return price * 0.1 def apply_discount(price): return price - (price * 0.1) # Good def calculate_discount(price, discount_rate): return price * discount_rate By centralizing logic, we avoid duplicating the same calculation across functions.\nKISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) # The KISS principle advocates for simplicity in code design. Overly complex solutions are harder to understand and maintain. Aim for the simplest solution that accomplishes the task effectively.\n// Bad function getNumberOfUsers(usersArray) { if (usersArray !== undefined \u0026amp;\u0026amp; usersArray.length \u0026gt; 0) { return usersArray.length; } return 0; } // Good function getNumberOfUsers(usersArray = []) { return usersArray.length; } Simplifying conditions and logic increases readability and reduces potential issues.\nYAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It) # The YAGNI principle discourages adding functionality until it’s necessary. Avoiding “just-in-case” features keeps code lean and prevents extra maintenance overhead.\n// Bad public class User { private String name; private String email; private String address; // Not needed now, but may be needed in the future } // Good public class User { private String name; private String email; } By only implementing necessary features, we avoid bloating the codebase.\nSOLID Principles # The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles aimed at making software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. SOLID stands for:\nSingle Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Depend on abstractions, not on concretions. Each of these principles encourages a modular, extensible approach to design, reducing the risk of tightly coupled code.\nEncapsulation # Encapsulation is about bundling related data and methods within a single unit (e.g., a class). It restricts direct access to some of an object’s components, which can help protect data integrity and prevent misuse.\nclass BankAccount { private balance: number; constructor(initialBalance: number) { this.balance = initialBalance; } deposit(amount: number): void { this.balance += amount; } getBalance(): number { return this.balance; } } By hiding the balance property, we prevent external code from modifying it directly.\nSeparation of Concerns # Separation of concerns involves dividing a program into distinct sections, each handling a specific aspect of the functionality. This approach improves modularity, makes code easier to maintain, and allows changes to one part without impacting others.\n// Controller for handling HTTP requests public class UserController { private UserService userService; public UserController(UserService userService) { this.userService = userService; } public User getUser(int id) { return userService.findUserById(id); } } // Service for business logic public class UserService { public User findUserById(int id) { // Logic for finding user } } This structure separates concerns of data handling, business logic, and presentation.\nLaw of Demeter # The Law of Demeter advises that an object should avoid interacting with too many other objects, especially not directly with objects it doesn’t “own.” This reduces dependencies and keeps code loosely coupled.\n# Bad user.order.cart.total # Good user.order_total Reducing “chained” interactions helps ensure changes in one class don’t ripple through unrelated parts of the code.\nComposition Over Inheritance # Favoring composition over inheritance allows for more flexible code reuse. Composition involves including instances of other classes within a class, rather than inheriting from a parent class.\n// Using composition class Engine { start() { console.log(\u0026#34;Engine started\u0026#34;); } } class Car { constructor() { this.engine = new Engine(); } start() { this.engine.start(); } } With composition, we can modify or replace behaviors more easily.\nFail Fast # The fail-fast principle means that errors should be detected and reported as soon as possible, ideally as close to their source as possible. This reduces the chances of encountering complex issues later in the program’s lifecycle.\nfunc divide(a, b int) (int, error) { if b == 0 { return 0, fmt.Errorf(\u0026#34;division by zero\u0026#34;) } return a / b, nil } By checking for errors early, we prevent cascading errors and improve reliability.\nCoding for Readability # Readable code is easier to maintain and debug. Always prioritize code readability by using clear naming, modular functions, and consistent formatting.\n// Bad $a = 10; $b = 5; $c = $a + $b; // Good $firstNumber = 10; $secondNumber = 5; $sum = $firstNumber + $secondNumber; Readable code reduces misunderstandings and makes it easier for new developers to contribute to the project.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/docs/coding-principles/go/","title":"Coding Principles in Go","section":"Coding Principles","content":" Coding Principles in Go # Go (Golang) is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and focus on readability.

Aim to keep your TypeScript code clear and straightforward.\n// Bad function getNumberOfUsers(usersArray: string[] | undefined): number { if (usersArray !== undefined \u0026amp;\u0026amp; usersArray.length \u0026gt; 0) { return usersArray.length; } return 0; } // Good function getNumberOfUsers(usersArray: string[] = []): number { return usersArray.length; } TypeScript-Specific Tip: Use default parameters, union types, and TypeScript’s type inference to simplify your functions.\nYAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It) # Avoid adding unnecessary properties or functionality in TypeScript classes. Static typing ensures you only include what’s needed, reducing maintenance overhead.\n// Bad class User { name: string; email: string; address: string = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; // Not needed now, but may be needed later constructor(name: string, email: string) { this.name = name; this.email = email; } } // Good class User { constructor(public name: string, public email: string) {} } TypeScript-Specific Tip: Leverage TypeScript’s constructor shorthand to keep your classes concise and avoid adding unused properties.\nSOLID Principles in TypeScript # The SOLID principles are design principles that make software more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. TypeScript’s class-based syntax and interfaces make it an ideal language for implementing SOLID.\nSingle Responsibility Principle (SRP) # A class or function should have one reason to change. Use TypeScript interfaces to separate concerns and encapsulate responsibilities.\n// Bad class User { constructor(public name: string, public email: string) {} saveToDatabase(): void { // Logic for saving to database } } // Good class User { constructor(public name: string, public email: string) {} } class UserRepository { save(user: User): void { // Logic for saving to database } } Open/Closed Principle (OCP) # Objects or functions should be open for extension but closed for modification. TypeScript’s interfaces and inheritance can help you extend functionality without modifying existing code.\n// Using inheritance to extend functionality interface Logger { log(message: string): void; } class ConsoleLogger implements Logger { log(message: string): void { console.log(message); } } class TimestampLogger extends ConsoleLogger { log(message: string): void { super.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] ${message}`); } } Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) # Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types. This principle encourages creating classes that can stand in for their parent classes without unexpected behavior.\nclass Rectangle { constructor(public width: number, public height: number) {} area(): number { return this.width * this.height; } } class Square extends Rectangle { constructor(side: number) { super(side, side); } } Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) # Interfaces should only include methods that are essential for their purpose. Define smaller, focused interfaces rather than one large interface.\ninterface Printable { print(): void; } interface Scannable { scan(): void; } class Printer implements Printable { print(): void { console.log(\u0026#34;Printing document...\u0026#34;); } } class MultifunctionPrinter implements Printable, Scannable { print(): void { console.log(\u0026#34;Printing document...\u0026#34;); } scan(): void { console.log(\u0026#34;Scanning document...\u0026#34;); } } Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) # Depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. Use interfaces in TypeScript to enforce loose coupling between classes.\ninterface Database { save(data: any): void; } class MongoDatabase implements Database { save(data: any): void { // Logic to save data to MongoDB } } class UserRepository { constructor(private database: Database) {} saveUser(user: any): void { this.database.save(user); } } Encapsulation # Encapsulation is a key feature of TypeScript. Use private and protected access modifiers to control access to class properties and methods.\nclass BankAccount { private balance: number; constructor(initialBalance: number) { this.balance = initialBalance; } deposit(amount: number): void { this.balance += amount; } getBalance(): number { return this.balance; } } Separation of Concerns # Separation of concerns is a core principle in TypeScript as well. By using classes and interfaces, you can modularize functionality and make code easier to manage.\n// Service for handling business logic class UserService { findUserById(id: number): any { // Logic for finding user } } // Controller for handling HTTP requests class UserController { constructor(private userService: UserService) {} getUser(id: number): any { return this.userService.findUserById(id); } } TypeScript-Specific Tip: TypeScript’s dependency injection support makes it easier to follow the separation of concerns principle, especially in frameworks like Angular.\nLaw of Demeter # The Law of Demeter discourages accessing nested objects directly. Instead, use functions to retrieve values.\n// Bad console.log(order.customer.address.city); // Good console.log(order.getCustomerCity()); Composition Over Inheritance # Composition is often preferable to inheritance, as it allows for more flexible and modular code. TypeScript’s interfaces and classes make composition straightforward.\n// Using composition class Engine { start(): void { console.log(\u0026#34;Engine started\u0026#34;); } } class Car { constructor(private engine: Engine) {} start(): void { this.engine.start(); } } const car = new Car(new Engine()); car.start(); // Engine started Fail Fast # The fail-fast principle means detecting errors as early as possible. TypeScript’s strict type checking enforces this principle by catching issues at compile-time.\nfunction divide(a: number, b: number): number { if (b === 0) throw new Error(\u0026#34;Division by zero\u0026#34;); return a / b; } try { console.log(divide(10, 0)); } catch (error) { console.error(error.message); } TypeScript-Specific Tip: Use TypeScript’s type system to validate inputs and catch errors before runtime.\nCoding for Readability # Readable code is essential in TypeScript. By using meaningful names, modular functions, and clear type annotations, you make the code more maintainable and understandable.\n// Bad let a = [1,2,3]; for (let i = 0; i \u0026lt; a.length; i++) console.log(a[i]); // Good const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3]; numbers.forEach((number) =\u0026gt; console.log(number)); TypeScript-Specific Tip: Use explicit types and access modifiers (public, private, protected) to improve readability and enforce consistency.\nTypeScript-Specific Principles # Use readonly for Immutability # Immutability is crucial in TypeScript, especially when working with complex data structures. Use readonly to enforce immutability in your classes.\nclass Point { constructor(public readonly x: number, public readonly y: number) {} } Prefer unknown over any # When dealing with unknown types, prefer unknown over any. This enforces type checking, ensuring you verify the type before using it.\nfunction process(value: unknown) { if (typeof value === \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;) { console.log(\u0026#34;String:\u0026#34;, value); } } Avoid Type Assertion # Type assertions (using as keyword) can be dangerous if misused. Avoid using them unless necessary, as they bypass TypeScript’s type checking.\n// Bad const inputValue = document.getElementById(\u0026#34;input\u0026#34;) as HTMLInputElement; // Good const inputElement = document.getElementById(\u0026#34;input\u0026#34;); if (inputElement instanceof HTMLInputElement) { inputElement.value = \u0026#34;Hello, TypeScript!\u0026#34;; } "},{"id":11,"href":"/docs/design-patterns/command/","title":"Command Pattern","section":"Design Patterns","content":" Command Pattern # The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize other objects with different requests, queue requests, log them, and implement undoable operations. The Command pattern decouples the sender of a request from the object that performs the action, providing flexibility and extensibility.\nIntent # The main intent of the Command pattern is to encapsulate a request as an object, allowing you to manage and manipulate it independently of the object that created the request. This pattern is particularly useful for actions that need to be queued, logged, or undone.\nProblem and Solution # Problem # Suppose you’re building a text editor that supports various operations, such as writing text, deleting text, and copying text. If you want to implement features like undo, redo, or macro recording, handling these actions directly in the client code can become complex and rigid, especially when operations are dependent on previous states.\nSolution # The Command pattern addresses this by creating command objects for each action (e.g., WriteTextCommand, DeleteTextCommand). Each command encapsulates the action and can be executed, stored, or reversed independently. This design simplifies adding new commands and enables undoable operations.\nStructure # The Command pattern typically includes:\nCommand Interface: Defines the execute method, which all commands must implement. Concrete Command: Implements the command interface and performs specific actions on a receiver. Receiver: The object that performs the actual work when a command is executed. Invoker: Initiates the command and keeps track of commands to support actions like undo. Client: Configures the invoker with specific commands.

We’ll create commands for writing and deleting text, each of which can be undone.\nStep 1: Define the Command Interface # The Command interface defines the execute and undo methods, which all commands must implement.\n// Command Interface interface Command { void execute(); void undo(); } Step 2: Implement the Receiver # The TextEditor class is the receiver that performs the actual operations on the text (e.g., adding or deleting text).\n// Receiver class TextEditor { private StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder(); public void writeText(String newText) { text.append(newText); } public void deleteText(int length) { text.delete(text.length() - length, text.length()); } public String getText() { return text.toString(); } } Step 3: Implement Concrete Commands # Each command encapsulates a specific action on the TextEditor. For example, WriteCommand writes text, while DeleteCommand removes text. Each command also implements undo to reverse its action.\n// Concrete Command for Writing Text class WriteCommand implements Command { private TextEditor editor; private String text; public WriteCommand(TextEditor editor, String text) { this.editor = editor; this.text = text; } @Override public void execute() { editor.writeText(text); } @Override public void undo() { editor.deleteText(text.length()); } } // Concrete Command for Deleting Text class DeleteCommand implements Command { private TextEditor editor; private String deletedText; public DeleteCommand(TextEditor editor, int length) { this.editor = editor; this.deletedText = editor.getText().substring(editor.getText().length() - length); } @Override public void execute() { editor.deleteText(deletedText.length()); } @Override public void undo() { editor.writeText(deletedText); } } Step 4: Implement the Invoker # The CommandManager class acts as an invoker, executing commands and keeping a history to support undo functionality.\n// Invoker class CommandManager { private Stack\u0026lt;Command\u0026gt; commandHistory = new Stack\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); public void executeCommand(Command command) { command.execute(); commandHistory.push(command); } public void undoLastCommand() { if (!commandHistory.isEmpty()) { commandHistory.pop().undo(); } } } Step 5: Client Code Using the Command Pattern # The client creates commands and executes them through the CommandManager, allowing actions to be undone if needed.\npublic class Client { public static void main(String[] args) { TextEditor editor = new TextEditor(); CommandManager commandManager = new CommandManager(); // Execute write commands Command writeHello = new WriteCommand(editor, \u0026#34;Hello \u0026#34;); Command writeWorld = new WriteCommand(editor, \u0026#34;World!\u0026#34;); commandManager.executeCommand(writeHello); commandManager.executeCommand(writeWorld); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Text after writing: \u0026#34; + editor.getText()); // Output: Hello World! // Undo the last command commandManager.undoLastCommand(); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Text after undo: \u0026#34; + editor.getText()); // Output: Hello // Redo the command commandManager.executeCommand(writeWorld); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Text after redoing: \u0026#34; + editor.getText()); // Output: Hello World! } } Output # Text after writing: Hello World! Text after undo: Hello Text after redoing: Hello World! In this example:\nThe TextEditor class performs operations on the text and serves as the receiver. WriteCommand and DeleteCommand encapsulate text operations and allow them to be undone. CommandManager executes commands and keeps a history of commands for undo functionality. Applicability # Use the Command pattern when:\nYou need to parameterize objects with operations, such as in menu items, buttons, or macro recording. You want to support undo/redo functionality, where each command can reverse its action. You need to queue or log requests for execution, allowing actions to be replayed or stored. Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Decouples Sender and Receiver: Command encapsulates requests, decoupling the object that initiates the request from the one that performs it. Supports Undo/Redo: The Command pattern makes it easy to implement undoable operations by tracking executed commands. Easily Extensible: Adding new commands is straightforward, as each command is self-contained and does not affect existing code. Disadvantages # Increased Complexity: The pattern can introduce extra classes, increasing code complexity, especially when many commands are involved. Potential Overhead: In some cases, storing and tracking all commands for undo/redo can lead to memory overhead. Best Practices for Implementing the Command Pattern # Use Command History for Undo/Redo: Maintain a history stack to allow easy implementation of undo/redo functionality. Limit Command Complexity: Avoid overly complex commands to keep the design simple and maintainable. Consider Reversible Actions: Implement undo only for commands that can be logically reversed, ensuring each command is self-contained. Conclusion # The Command pattern provides a powerful way to encapsulate requests, allowing flexible handling of operations, including support for undo, redo, and macro recording. By decoupling the invoker from the executor, this pattern enhances flexibility and modularity in the system.\n"},{"id":12,"href":"/docs/design-patterns/composite/","title":"Composite Pattern","section":"Design Patterns","content":" Composite Pattern # The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern enables clients to treat individual objects and groups of objects uniformly, making it particularly useful for handling complex structures such as directories, menus, and graphical objects.\nIntent # The main intent of the Composite pattern is to allow clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This pattern enables the creation of a tree structure, where both simple and complex elements implement the same interface, making it easier to work with complex object hierarchies.\nProblem and Solution # Problem # Suppose you are developing a graphical editor where each shape can contain other shapes, such as groups of circles, rectangles, and lines. You want the application to treat single shapes and groups of shapes uniformly, allowing operations like drawing, resizing, and moving to apply to both individual shapes and groups.\nSolution # The Composite pattern allows you to define an abstract interface for all shapes, with methods like draw and resize. Individual shapes and groups of shapes (composites) both implement this interface. The composite (group) can contain other shapes or groups, enabling the creation of a recursive tree structure.\nStructure # The Composite pattern typically includes:\nComponent: An interface or abstract class defining common operations for both individual and composite objects. Leaf: Represents individual objects in the composition (e.g., Circle, Rectangle). Composite: Represents groups of Leaf objects and other Composite objects, managing children and implementing operations on the group.

The CompositeGraphic class represents a group of Graphic objects and also implements the draw method by iterating over its children. The client code can use draw on both individual shapes and groups of shapes without needing to know whether each element is a single shape or a composite. Applicability # Use the Composite pattern when:\nYou need to represent part-whole hierarchies, such as graphical objects, menus, or file directories. You want clients to treat individual objects and groups of objects uniformly, without needing to distinguish between them. You have complex structures that benefit from being managed as nested groups or trees. Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Unified Interface: Composite provides a unified interface for handling individual and composite objects, simplifying client code. Easier Tree Structures: The pattern enables easy creation and management of complex, hierarchical structures, such as directories or UI components. Scalability: Composite allows you to add new types of components and composites without changing the existing code, following the Open-Closed Principle. Disadvantages # Complex Management: Managing composite hierarchies can become complex, especially with deep or large tree structures. Limited Safety with Leaf-Specific Operations: In certain cases, leaf nodes may need specific operations that don’t apply to composites, which can complicate the design. Overhead for Simple Structures: For simpler scenarios, using the Composite pattern may add unnecessary complexity. Best Practices for Implementing the Composite Pattern # Avoid Assumptions About Components: Ensure that client code does not make assumptions about whether a Graphic is a leaf or a composite. Use Recursion for Composite Operations: Composite structures often benefit from recursive operations, allowing each element to perform its action in a tree structure. Consider Interface Segregation: If some operations apply only to specific components, consider using smaller interfaces or segregated operations to prevent unexpected behavior. Conclusion # The Composite pattern provides a powerful way to work with complex hierarchical structures, enabling clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. By leveraging this pattern, you can build flexible and scalable structures for applications involving tree-like relationships.\n"},{"id":13,"href":"/docs/design-patterns/decorator/","title":"Decorator Pattern","section":"Design Patterns","content":" Decorator Pattern # The Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to dynamically add responsibilities to objects by placing them inside \u0026ldquo;wrapper\u0026rdquo; objects that contain additional functionality. The Decorator pattern enables flexible and reusable code by providing an alternative to subclassing for extending behavior.\nIntent # The main intent of the Decorator pattern is to add new functionality to an object dynamically without altering its structure or affecting other objects of the same class. This pattern allows you to stack behaviors on objects in a way that is flexible and adheres to the Open-Closed Principle.\nProblem and Solution # Problem # Suppose you have a TextEditor that displays text and can have multiple formatting options, such as bold, italic, and underline. If you use inheritance to implement each combination (e.g., BoldTextEditor, BoldItalicTextEditor, etc.), the number of classes grows rapidly, and the code becomes difficult to maintain.\nSolution # The Decorator pattern solves this problem by allowing you to \u0026ldquo;wrap\u0026rdquo; the TextEditor object with decorators that add specific functionalities. You can stack multiple decorators around a single object, enabling any combination of behaviors dynamically at runtime.\nStructure # The Decorator pattern typically includes:\nComponent Interface: Defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them dynamically.

PlainText is the base component that displays plain text. BoldTextDecorator and ItalicTextDecorator are concrete decorators that add bold and italic formatting, respectively. The client can combine multiple decorators to create complex formatting dynamically. Applicability # Use the Decorator pattern when:\nYou need to add responsibilities to objects dynamically and flexibly. You want to avoid subclassing, as it would lead to a large number of classes for every possible combination of behaviors. You need to add different combinations of behaviors to objects without modifying the base class or the client code. Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Flexible Behavior Extension: Decorator allows you to add or remove behaviors at runtime without modifying the original object. Adheres to Open-Closed Principle: New behaviors can be added by creating new decorators, rather than modifying existing classes. Combining Multiple Behaviors: You can stack multiple decorators around an object to create complex behaviors dynamically. Disadvantages # Increased Complexity: The Decorator pattern introduces additional classes, which may increase complexity, especially when many decorators are combined. Hard to Debug: Multiple layers of decorators can make it difficult to debug and trace the flow of execution. Order Sensitivity: The order in which decorators are applied can impact the final behavior, requiring careful attention. Best Practices for Implementing the Decorator Pattern # Use Composition Over Inheritance: Decorators should wrap objects instead of extending them, making the pattern more flexible. Limit Decorator Stacking: While multiple decorators can be stacked, avoid overuse, as this can lead to confusion and increased complexity. Use Naming Conventions: Clear naming for decorators helps in understanding the chain of decorators applied to an object. Conclusion # The Decorator pattern provides a flexible and dynamic way to add behaviors to objects without modifying their structure.

It states:\n“High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.”\nIn simpler terms, DIP encourages us to decouple high-level business logic from low-level details by relying on abstract interfaces or classes instead of concrete implementations. This approach promotes flexibility, ease of testing, and scalability.\nWhy Use the Dependency Inversion Principle? # In a traditional, tightly coupled system, high-level modules (responsible for core business logic) depend directly on low-level modules (which provide specific functionality, such as data access or external APIs). This setup leads to brittle code: changes in low-level modules require modifications in high-level modules, causing ripple effects across the codebase.\nBy using DIP, we can:\nEnhance Flexibility: The system becomes modular, allowing us to change implementations without modifying high-level code. Facilitate Testing: High-level modules depend on abstractions, which can be easily mocked for unit testing. Reduce Dependencies: DIP allows each module to operate independently, minimizing the need for direct dependency. Key Concepts of DIP # Abstraction Layers: Both high-level and low-level modules depend on an abstract layer (e.g., an interface or an abstract class). This way, the high-level module does not rely on the specific implementation of the low-level module. Inversion of Control (IoC): DIP is often implemented through IoC, which dictates that the responsibility of creating and injecting dependencies shifts to a different part of the program (often an IoC container or dependency injection framework). Dependency Injection (DI): DI is a specific implementation of IoC, where dependencies are passed into an object rather than being instantiated within the object. DI helps keep high-level modules unaware of the specific low-level implementations. DIP in Action # Let\u0026rsquo;s look at an example where DIP improves code structure and flexibility.\nWithout DIP: Tightly Coupled Code # Consider an application that sends notifications. Without DIP, a high-level NotificationService class might directly depend on a EmailService class, which performs the actual email sending.\nclass EmailService { public void sendEmail(String message) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Sending email: \u0026#34; + message); } } class NotificationService { private EmailService emailService; public NotificationService() { this.emailService = new EmailService(); } public void notify(String message) { emailService.sendEmail(message); } } In this setup:\nThe NotificationService depends directly on EmailService, making it hard to extend or replace EmailService with other notification channels, like SMS or push notifications. Testing NotificationService is challenging since we cannot easily replace EmailService with a mock. With DIP: Decoupled Code # Let’s refactor this code to adhere to DIP by introducing an abstraction NotificationChannel. Now, NotificationService depends on NotificationChannel rather than a specific email service, allowing flexibility.\n// Abstract Interface interface NotificationChannel { void send(String message); } // Low-level Modules Implementing the Interface class EmailService implements NotificationChannel { public void send(String message) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Sending email: \u0026#34; + message); } } class SMSService implements NotificationChannel { public void send(String message) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Sending SMS: \u0026#34; + message); } } // High-level Module class NotificationService { private NotificationChannel channel; // Dependency Injection through constructor public NotificationService(NotificationChannel channel) { this.channel = channel; } public void notify(String message) { channel.send(message); } } Now, NotificationService is more flexible:\nWe can inject any implementation of NotificationChannel, such as EmailService or SMSService, without changing the high-level module. Testing is simpler; we can inject a mock NotificationChannel to verify that the notify method calls the send method correctly. Using DIP with Dependency Injection Frameworks # Many modern frameworks provide built-in support for Dependency Injection, such as Spring in Java, ASP.NET Core in C#, and NestJS in JavaScript. These frameworks automatically manage dependency injection, simplifying the setup.\nFor instance, in Spring:\n@Service class EmailService implements NotificationChannel { public void send(String message) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Sending email: \u0026#34; + message); } } @Service class NotificationService { private final NotificationChannel channel; // Spring automatically injects the dependency @Autowired public NotificationService(NotificationChannel channel) { this.channel = channel; } public void notify(String message) { channel.send(message); } } Here, Spring injects the NotificationChannel dependency based on configuration, allowing for easy swapping between implementations.\nBenefits and Challenges of DIP # Benefits # Decoupling: DIP reduces coupling between high-level and low-level modules, making code more modular. Scalability: The system is easier to extend, as new low-level modules can be introduced without modifying the high-level module. Testability: Code is easier to unit test, as dependencies can be mocked or stubbed out. Challenges # Increased Complexity: Introducing abstractions adds complexity, which can be challenging for smaller projects or less experienced developers. Overhead in Small Projects: For small projects, the added layers of abstraction may feel like overengineering, as they introduce additional code that may not provide significant benefits. Proper Abstraction Design: Poorly designed abstractions can lead to leaky abstractions or confusing code. Careful design is essential to avoid complexity. Best Practices for Implementing DIP # Design Clear Abstractions: Ensure that abstractions are meaningful and that each interface or abstract class has a clear purpose. Use Dependency Injection Libraries: In large projects, consider using DI libraries or frameworks to manage dependencies efficiently and avoid boilerplate code. Apply DIP Where It Adds Value: Not every part of your code needs DIP. Apply it primarily where flexibility and testability are essential. Conclusion # The Dependency Inversion Principle is a powerful design principle that reduces the dependency between high-level and low-level modules by relying on abstractions. By adhering to DIP, we create code that is more flexible, easier to test, and less prone to breaking when details change. Although DIP may introduce complexity, the benefits often outweigh the challenges, especially in larger applications where decoupling and testability are paramount.\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/docs/design-patterns/","title":"Design Patterns","section":"Docs","content":" Design Patterns # Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They provide templates for solving issues related to object creation, composition, and communication, allowing developers to build robust, scalable, and maintainable systems. Rather than reinventing the wheel, design patterns offer established ways to tackle challenges, making it easier to design flexible and efficient code.\nThis section explores various design patterns, grouped by their purpose and functionality.\nWhy Use Design Patterns? # Design patterns are valuable because they:\nPromote Reusability: Patterns provide tried-and-tested solutions that can be reused across different projects. Improve Communication: They give developers a common vocabulary for describing solutions, improving collaboration and understanding. Encourage Best Practices: Patterns help enforce good design principles, such as modularity, decoupling, and encapsulation. Increase Flexibility: Many patterns allow for extensibility, making it easier to adapt to new requirements or changes in the system. Types of Design Patterns # Design patterns are generally classified into three main categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. Each category addresses different types of design challenges and offers patterns suited to solving specific problems.\n1. Creational Patterns # Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, aiming to increase flexibility and reuse of code. They help ensure that objects are created in a manner suitable to the situation, avoiding tight coupling and increasing code modularity.\nAbstract Factory: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. Builder: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing different representations to be created. Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of object that will be created. Prototype: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, making it easy to duplicate complex objects. Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. 2. Structural Patterns # Structural patterns focus on composing classes and objects to form larger structures, facilitating the creation of flexible and scalable code. These patterns help establish relationships between entities, making it easier to implement new functionality without changing the existing code.\nAdapter: Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect, allowing incompatible interfaces to work together. Bridge: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. Composite: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, enabling clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly. Decorator: Adds responsibilities to an object dynamically, providing an alternative to subclassing. Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use. Flyweight: Reduces memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. Proxy: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. 3. Behavioral Patterns # Behavioral patterns deal with object interactions and responsibilities, defining ways for objects to communicate and interact while keeping the code flexible and scalable. These patterns focus on algorithms, delegation, and the distribution of responsibility.\nChain of Responsibility: Passes a request along a chain of handlers, allowing each handler to process or pass it to the next handler in the chain. Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. Iterator: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. Mediator: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, reducing the complexity of many-to-many communication. Memento: Captures and externalizes an object’s internal state so that it can be restored later, without violating encapsulation. Observer: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all dependents are notified and updated. State: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing as if it changes class. Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable to let the algorithm vary independently from clients. Template Method: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, letting subclasses override specific steps without changing its structure. Visitor: Represents an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure, allowing for new operations to be added without changing the classes of the elements. How to Use This Section # Each design pattern page provides:\nDescription: An overview of the pattern’s purpose and problem-solving approach. Example Code: Sample implementations to illustrate how the pattern works. Applicability: Situations where the pattern is most useful. Advantages and Disadvantages: Key benefits and trade-offs associated with each pattern. Understanding and using design patterns can greatly improve the design and structure of your code, making it more adaptable, reusable, and maintainable.\n"},{"id":16,"href":"/docs/design-patterns/facade/","title":"Facade Pattern","section":"Design Patterns","content":" Facade Pattern # The Facade pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem of classes. It offers a single entry point that abstracts the underlying complexity of various components, making the subsystem easier to use and interact with. This pattern is especially useful when working with a complicated library or set of APIs.\nIntent # The main intent of the Facade pattern is to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem, allowing clients to interact with the subsystem without needing to understand its complexity. This pattern promotes loose coupling by hiding the inner workings of the subsystem from the client, presenting only what is necessary.\nProblem and Solution # Problem # Suppose you are building a multimedia application that needs to work with a complex audio and video subsystem. This subsystem includes multiple classes, such as AudioMixer, VideoDecoder, and Codec, which need to be configured and coordinated to play or record multimedia files. Without a simplified interface, the client code would need to understand and manage each component individually, which is tedious and error-prone.\nSolution # The Facade pattern can solve this problem by creating a MediaFacade class that provides a simplified interface for playing and recording multimedia. The MediaFacade class coordinates the interactions between the underlying components, hiding their complexity from the client.\nStructure # The Facade pattern typically includes:\nFacade: Provides a simple interface to the complex subsystem and delegates requests to the appropriate components. Subsystem Classes: The underlying classes that perform the actual work. These classes are hidden behind the facade.

We’ll create a MediaFacade class that simplifies the process of playing multimedia files by coordinating various subsystem classes (e.g., AudioMixer, VideoDecoder, and Codec).\nStep 1: Define Subsystem Classes # Each subsystem class handles a specific task, such as mixing audio, decoding video, or applying codecs. These classes would typically have complex methods and interactions.\n// Subsystem class for Audio Mixing class AudioMixer { public void mixAudio(String file) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Mixing audio for \u0026#34; + file); } } // Subsystem class for Video Decoding class VideoDecoder { public void decodeVideo(String file) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Decoding video for \u0026#34; + file); } } // Subsystem class for Codec Application class Codec { public void applyCodec(String file) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Applying codec for \u0026#34; + file); } } Step 2: Implement the Facade # The MediaFacade class provides a simple interface for playing multimedia. It uses the subsystem classes internally, managing their interactions to simplify the process for the client.\n// Facade class MediaFacade { private AudioMixer audioMixer; private VideoDecoder videoDecoder; private Codec codec; public MediaFacade() { this.audioMixer = new AudioMixer(); this.videoDecoder = new VideoDecoder(); this.codec = new Codec(); } public void playMedia(String file) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Starting media playback for \u0026#34; + file); codec.applyCodec(file); videoDecoder.decodeVideo(file); audioMixer.mixAudio(file); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Playing \u0026#34; + file); } } Step 3: Client Code Using the Facade # The client interacts with the MediaFacade to play a media file without needing to manage each component individually.\npublic class Client { public static void main(String[] args) { MediaFacade mediaFacade = new MediaFacade(); mediaFacade.playMedia(\u0026#34;example.mp4\u0026#34;); // Simplified playback } } Output # Starting media playback for example.mp4 Applying codec for example.mp4 Decoding video for example.mp4 Mixing audio for example.mp4 Playing example.mp4 In this example:\nThe MediaFacade class provides a simplified playMedia method that the client can use to play multimedia files. The subsystem classes (AudioMixer, VideoDecoder, Codec) perform the actual work but are hidden behind the facade. The client does not need to understand or interact with the individual subsystem classes directly. Applicability # Use the Facade pattern when:\nYou have a complex subsystem with multiple components, and you want to simplify the interaction for the client. You want to decouple client code from the subsystem, making the subsystem easier to replace or modify without affecting the client. You want to provide a single, unified interface to a set of related classes, particularly in libraries or frameworks. Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Simplifies Client Interactions: Facade provides a simple interface to a complex system, making it easier for clients to interact with the system. Promotes Loose Coupling: By decoupling client code from the subsystem, the Facade pattern reduces dependencies and increases flexibility. Improves Code Readability: Facade can improve the readability and maintainability of code by hiding complex logic behind a simple interface. Disadvantages # Limited Access to Subsystem Features: Facade may hide some of the subsystem’s features, limiting flexibility if clients need specific functionality. Increased Complexity: In some cases, a Facade class may add unnecessary complexity if the subsystem is already straightforward. Potential Overuse: Facades should be applied judiciously. Overusing them can lead to bloated interfaces that obscure important functionality. Best Practices for Implementing the Facade Pattern # Design with Simplicity in Mind: Keep the facade interface simple and focused on common operations that clients need. Use Facade to Decouple Subsystems: Use the Facade pattern to encapsulate complex interactions and dependencies, helping to decouple systems. Avoid Bloated Facades: Only expose functionality that is commonly needed by clients to avoid overwhelming the facade interface. Conclusion # The Facade pattern is a powerful tool for providing a simple interface to complex subsystems, reducing the complexity for clients and promoting loose coupling. This pattern is especially useful for simplifying interactions with libraries, APIs, or systems with multiple interdependent components.\n"},{"id":17,"href":"/docs/design-patterns/factory-method/","title":"Factory Method Pattern","section":"Design Patterns","content":" Factory Method Pattern # The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. This pattern lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses, promoting flexibility and loose coupling in the codebase.\nIntent # The main intent of the Factory Method pattern is to define a method in a superclass for creating objects but to let subclasses determine the specific class of object that will be instantiated. This pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying their exact type in the code.\nProblem and Solution # Problem # Suppose you are building a logistics application that needs to create various types of transport vehicles, such as Truck and Ship. The exact type of transport might depend on the logistics route (land or sea). If you try to instantiate each type within the main application logic, you risk tightly coupling the code to specific classes, making it harder to extend or maintain.\nSolution # The Factory Method pattern enables you to define a TransportFactory interface with a createTransport method. Subclasses can implement this interface to create specific transport types, such as Truck or Ship, without modifying the main application logic.\nStructure # The Factory Method pattern typically includes:\nCreator (Abstract Class or Interface): Declares a factory method that returns new objects of a certain type. Concrete Creators: Implement the factory method to create specific types of objects. Product (Interface or Abstract Class): Defines the interface for the objects the factory method creates.

TransportFactory shipFactory = new ShipFactory(); shipFactory.planDelivery(); // Output: Delivering by sea with a ship. } } Explanation # In this example:\nTransportFactory defines a createTransport method that subclasses override to specify the type of transport to be created. TruckFactory and ShipFactory are concrete factories that produce Truck and Ship objects, respectively. The client code can create and use transport objects without knowing their exact type, adhering to the Open-Closed Principle and promoting loose coupling. Applicability # Use the Factory Method pattern when:\nYou want to allow subclasses to alter the type of object created. You have a common interface or base class but want to delegate instantiation to subclasses. You want to reduce dependencies between a main class and specific classes, especially when types may change over time. Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Promotes Loose Coupling: The Factory Method pattern decouples client code from specific implementations, making the system more flexible and modular. Supports Open-Closed Principle: New types of products can be added without modifying the client code. Increases Extensibility: Adding new factories and products is straightforward and doesn’t disrupt existing code. Disadvantages # Increased Complexity: The Factory Method pattern introduces additional classes and complexity, which can be excessive for simple projects. Requires Subclassing: To add new product types, new subclasses must be created, which may lead to a more complex hierarchy. Best Practices for Implementing the Factory Method Pattern # Use Factory Method for Complex Object Creation: For simple objects, this pattern might be overkill. Reserve it for cases where the construction process benefits from being centralized and managed by subclasses. Favor Interface-Based Products: Define a common interface for products to keep client code consistent and make adding new products easier. Consider Alternative Patterns for Object Creation: In cases where only one type of object is needed, simpler patterns like the Simple Factory or Singleton might be more appropriate. Conclusion # The Factory Method pattern provides a flexible and modular way to create objects, allowing subclasses to control the instantiation process. By deferring object creation to subclasses, this pattern promotes loose coupling and extensibility, making it easier to add new product types without modifying existing code.\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/docs/design-patterns/flyweight/","title":"Flyweight Pattern","section":"Design Patterns","content":" Flyweight Pattern # The Flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern that focuses on minimizing memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. This pattern is especially effective in systems where a large number of similar objects are created, such as in graphics applications or document editing software.\nIntent # The main intent of the Flyweight pattern is to reduce memory usage by sharing parts of the object state that are common to many objects, allowing many instances to share the same data. This pattern promotes the reuse of objects that have shared properties, saving memory and improving performance.\nProblem and Solution # Problem # Imagine you’re building a graphical editor that needs to display thousands of characters with different font types, sizes, and colors. Creating an object for each character could lead to high memory usage, as many characters share similar properties. Without Flyweight, you’d end up with redundant data stored in each character object.\nSolution # The Flyweight pattern addresses this problem by splitting the state of objects into intrinsic (shared) and extrinsic (unique) states:\nIntrinsic State: Common, unchanging data that can be shared (e.g., font type, font size). Extrinsic State: Data that is unique to each instance and cannot be shared (e.g., position on screen). By storing the intrinsic state in a shared object, we can reduce the number of objects and overall memory usage.\nStructure # The Flyweight pattern typically includes:\nFlyweight: Declares the interface through which flyweights can receive and act on extrinsic state. Concrete Flyweight: Implements the flyweight interface and stores intrinsic state. Flyweight Factory: Manages a pool of flyweight objects, returning existing instances if they match the requested intrinsic state. Client: Maintains and provides extrinsic state to flyweights when needed.

Each character will have intrinsic properties (e.g., font and size) and extrinsic properties (e.g., position), allowing the editor to reuse character objects for similar fonts and sizes.\nStep 1: Define the Flyweight Interface # The Character interface defines the draw method, which accepts extrinsic state as parameters.\n// Flyweight Interface interface Character { void draw(int x, int y); } Step 2: Implement the Concrete Flyweight # The ConcreteCharacter class represents a specific character with intrinsic state (e.g., font and size). The draw method uses extrinsic state (position) provided by the client.\n// Concrete Flyweight class ConcreteCharacter implements Character { private char symbol; private String font; private int size; public ConcreteCharacter(char symbol, String font, int size) { this.symbol = symbol; this.font = font; this.size = size; } @Override public void draw(int x, int y) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Drawing \u0026#39;\u0026#34; + symbol + \u0026#34;\u0026#39; at (\u0026#34; + x + \u0026#34;,\u0026#34; + y + \u0026#34;) in font \u0026#34; + font + \u0026#34; with size \u0026#34; + size); } } Step 3: Implement the Flyweight Factory # The CharacterFactory class manages a pool of characters based on intrinsic state (character symbol, font, and size).

The ConcreteCharacter class stores intrinsic state, while extrinsic state is provided during the draw call. a1 and a2 share the same intrinsic state, so they are the same instance, reducing memory usage. Applicability # Use the Flyweight pattern when:\nYou need a large number of objects, and most of their properties can be shared, saving memory. You want to reduce memory usage by sharing common data across multiple objects. Your objects have both intrinsic (shared) and extrinsic (unique) properties, allowing for partial reuse. Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Reduced Memory Usage: Flyweight saves memory by sharing intrinsic data across multiple objects. Efficient Object Management: Flyweight reduces the need for duplicate objects, making it easier to manage large collections of similar objects. Improved Performance: By reducing memory usage, Flyweight can improve performance, especially in memory-constrained applications. Disadvantages # Increased Complexity: The Flyweight pattern can add complexity to code due to the separation of intrinsic and extrinsic state. Dependency on Client for Extrinsic State: The client is responsible for passing extrinsic state, which can lead to errors if not managed correctly. Limited Use Case: The pattern is primarily useful in situations with many similar objects. For unique objects, the pattern provides little benefit. Best Practices for Implementing the Flyweight Pattern # Clearly Separate Intrinsic and Extrinsic State: Clearly define which parts of the object state are shared and which are unique to ensure the pattern is applied effectively. Use a Factory for Object Management: Use a factory class to manage and reuse flyweight instances, avoiding direct instantiation by clients. Evaluate Memory Trade-offs: Apply the Flyweight pattern only when memory savings are significant, as it can add complexity to your design. Conclusion # The Flyweight pattern provides an efficient way to manage memory usage by sharing intrinsic state across similar objects. This pattern is particularly useful in systems where many objects share common data, allowing for flexible, optimized object creation while reducing overall memory consumption.\n"},{"id":19,"href":"/docs/coding-principles/solid/interface-segregation/","title":"Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)","section":"Coding Principles","content":" Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) # The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is the fourth principle in the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states:\n“A client should not be forced to depend on methods it does not use.”\nIn simpler terms, ISP encourages us to create more focused, specific interfaces rather than large, general-purpose interfaces. This makes interfaces easier to implement, reduces unnecessary dependencies, and improves code flexibility.\nWhy Use the Interface Segregation Principle? # When interfaces are too large, they often include methods that certain implementations do not need. This leads to what’s known as a \u0026ldquo;fat interface,\u0026rdquo; which can create problems such as:\nUnused Methods: Implementations may need to define empty or meaningless implementations for methods they don’t use. Tight Coupling: Clients are unnecessarily dependent on methods they don’t need, making the system harder to extend, test, and maintain. Decreased Flexibility: If a large interface changes, all implementing classes are affected, even if they only use a subset of the methods. By adhering to ISP, we ensure that interfaces remain focused and adaptable, leading to a more modular and maintainable codebase.\nKey Concepts of ISP # Small, Focused Interfaces: Each interface should have a single responsibility or a narrow set of responsibilities, serving a specific role in the system. Client-Specific Interfaces: Rather than creating a general-purpose interface that covers many needs, create separate interfaces tailored to each client’s specific requirements. Avoid \u0026ldquo;Fat Interfaces\u0026rdquo;: Large interfaces with too many methods should be split into smaller, more specific ones, even if this means creating multiple interfaces for similar functionalities. ISP in Action # Let’s consider an example that demonstrates how ISP can improve design.\nWithout ISP: Fat Interface # Imagine we’re building an application for different types of printers. If we start with a general-purpose Printer interface that includes methods for printing, scanning, and faxing, it might look like this:\ninterface Printer { void print(Document doc); void scan(Document doc); void fax(Document doc); } class BasicPrinter implements Printer { public void print(Document doc) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Printing document...\u0026#34;); } public void scan(Document doc) { // Not supported throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\u0026#34;Scan not supported\u0026#34;); } public void fax(Document doc) { // Not supported throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\u0026#34;Fax not supported\u0026#34;); } } In this example:\nThe BasicPrinter only supports printing, yet it is forced to implement scan and fax, resulting in methods that throw exceptions. Every class that implements Printer must implement all three methods, regardless of which ones are actually needed. With ISP: Segregated Interfaces # Following ISP, we can break down the Printer interface into smaller, more specific interfaces, allowing each printer type to implement only the functionality it needs:\ninterface Printable { void print(Document doc); } interface Scannable { void scan(Document doc); } interface Faxable { void fax(Document doc); } // Implementations for different types of printers class BasicPrinter implements Printable { public void print(Document doc) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Printing document...\u0026#34;); } } class MultiFunctionPrinter implements Printable, Scannable, Faxable { public void print(Document doc) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Printing document...\u0026#34;); } public void scan(Document doc) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Scanning document...\u0026#34;); } public void fax(Document doc) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Faxing document...\u0026#34;); } } With this approach:\nBasicPrinter now only implements Printable and isn’t forced to provide meaningless implementations for scan or fax. MultiFunctionPrinter can implement all three interfaces as it needs all three functionalities. This design aligns with ISP by ensuring each printer type depends only on the methods it actually needs.\nImplementing ISP with Adapter Pattern # Sometimes, when working with legacy systems or large interfaces that cannot be modified, the Adapter Pattern can help adhere to ISP. Adapters allow us to create smaller interfaces while still interacting with a larger, unchangeable interface.\nLet’s assume we have a legacy AdvancedPrinter class with many methods that we don’t control.\nclass AdvancedPrinter { public void print(Document doc) { /* ... */ } public void scan(Document doc) { /* ... */ } public void fax(Document doc) { /* ... */ } public void email(Document doc) { /* ... */ } } We can create adapter classes with smaller, focused interfaces to interact with this advanced printer:\ninterface Printable { void print(Document doc); } class PrintAdapter implements Printable { private AdvancedPrinter advancedPrinter; public PrintAdapter(AdvancedPrinter advancedPrinter) { this.advancedPrinter = advancedPrinter; } public void print(Document doc) { advancedPrinter.print(doc); } } This adapter allows us to interact with AdvancedPrinter using the Printable interface, even though AdvancedPrinter has a larger interface.\nBenefits and Challenges of ISP # Benefits # Enhanced Modularity: By dividing responsibilities among smaller interfaces, we create a modular design that is easier to understand and modify. Improved Flexibility: Classes can depend on specific interfaces, which makes it easier to change implementations without affecting other parts of the code. Better Testability: Smaller, focused interfaces allow for more isolated and effective testing. Challenges # Increased Number of Interfaces: Following ISP often leads to a greater number of interfaces, which can add complexity to the codebase if not managed well. Design Complexity: Over-segmenting interfaces can lead to fragmentation, which may be counterproductive in smaller projects or simpler applications. Maintaining Consistency: Ensuring that interfaces are logically and consistently defined across a codebase requires careful design to avoid confusion. Best Practices for Implementing ISP # Identify Client Needs Early: Design interfaces based on the specific needs of each client to prevent fat interfaces from forming. Favor Composition: Use composition rather than inheritance when possible, as this approach naturally encourages smaller, more focused interfaces. Review and Refactor Regularly: As requirements change, interfaces should be reviewed and refactored to keep them aligned with the needs of the clients. Conclusion # The Interface Segregation Principle is a crucial design principle that promotes focused, client-specific interfaces. By applying ISP, we avoid fat interfaces, reduce coupling, and build more modular, testable code. Although it may introduce more interfaces, the increased flexibility and improved design often justify the added complexity.\nWith ISP, each class and client depends only on the methods it actually uses, leading to cleaner, more maintainable code. Following this principle helps create software that is easy to extend, modify, and test.\n"},{"id":20,"href":"/docs/design-patterns/iterator/","title":"Iterator Pattern","section":"Design Patterns","content":" Iterator Pattern # The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the collection\u0026rsquo;s underlying structure.

We’ll create an IntegerCollection with a NumberIterator to allow sequential access to the numbers.\nStep 1: Define the Iterator Interface # The Iterator interface defines methods for traversal: hasNext to check if there are more elements and next to retrieve the next element.\n// Iterator Interface interface Iterator\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { boolean hasNext(); T next(); } Step 2: Implement the Concrete Iterator # The NumberIterator class implements the Iterator interface to traverse an IntegerCollection.\n// Concrete Iterator class NumberIterator implements Iterator\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; { private IntegerCollection collection; private int position = 0; public NumberIterator(IntegerCollection collection) { this.collection = collection; } @Override public boolean hasNext() { return position \u0026lt; collection.size(); } @Override public Integer next() { return hasNext() ? collection.get(position++) : null; } } Step 3: Define the Collection Interface # The Collection interface defines a method for creating an iterator, allowing clients to retrieve an iterator for traversing the collection.\n// Collection Interface interface Collection\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { Iterator\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; createIterator(); } Step 4: Implement the Concrete Collection # The IntegerCollection class implements the Collection interface, storing integers and returning an iterator for traversal.\n// Concrete Collection class IntegerCollection implements Collection\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; { private List\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; numbers = new ArrayList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); public void add(Integer number) { numbers.add(number); } public Integer get(int index) { return numbers.get(index); } public int size() { return numbers.size(); } @Override public Iterator\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; createIterator() { return new NumberIterator(this); } } Step 5: Client Code Using the Iterator # The client code uses the iterator provided by IntegerCollection to access elements sequentially without knowing the collection’s internal structure.\npublic class Client { public static void main(String[] args) { IntegerCollection collection = new IntegerCollection(); collection.add(1); collection.add(2); collection.add(3); Iterator\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; iterator = collection.createIterator(); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Iterating through the collection:\u0026#34;); while (iterator.hasNext()) { System.out.println(iterator.next()); } } } Output # Iterating through the collection: 1 2 3 In this example:\nThe IntegerCollection class provides the createIterator method, allowing the client to obtain a NumberIterator. The NumberIterator traverses the IntegerCollection sequentially, implementing the hasNext and next methods. The client code iterates through the collection without knowing its internal structure, relying solely on the iterator. Applicability # Use the Iterator pattern when:\nYou need to traverse a collection without exposing its underlying representation. You want to support different types of traversals (e.g., forward, backward) for a collection. You need to provide a uniform interface for traversing different types of collections. Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Encapsulation of Traversal Logic: The Iterator pattern encapsulates the traversal logic, allowing the collection’s structure to remain hidden from the client. Simplifies Collection Interaction: The pattern provides a standard interface for iterating over collections, making it easier to interact with complex data structures. Supports Multiple Iterations: Multiple iterators can be created for the same collection, enabling multiple independent traversals. Disadvantages # Increased Complexity: The pattern introduces additional classes (e.g., iterators), which can add complexity, especially for simple collections. Potential for Concurrent Modification Issues: Iterators may encounter issues if the collection is modified during iteration, requiring additional safeguards or implementations for concurrent modification handling. Best Practices for Implementing the Iterator Pattern # Use the Iterator Pattern for Complex Collections: Apply this pattern when collections have complex structures or traversal requirements. For simpler collections, native iteration mechanisms may suffice. Provide Clear Traversal Methods: Ensure that hasNext and next methods are intuitive and handle edge cases (e.g., reaching the end of the collection) gracefully. Handle Concurrent Modifications Carefully: If the collection might be modified during iteration, implement safeguards like fail-fast or fail-safe iterators. Conclusion # The Iterator pattern provides a flexible way to access elements in a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying structure. This pattern enables uniform traversal methods, supporting complex or custom collections while keeping the client code simple and decoupled from collection details.\n"},{"id":21,"href":"/docs/coding-principles/solid/liskov-substitution/","title":"Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)","section":"Coding Principles","content":" Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) # The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is the third principle in the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states:\n“Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.”\nIn other words, if class B is a subclass of class A, then instances of A should be replaceable by instances of B without altering the program\u0026rsquo;s behavior. LSP ensures that a derived class can stand in for its base class without breaking functionality, making inheritance more predictable and reliable.\nWhy Use the Liskov Substitution Principle? # Violations of LSP can lead to unexpected bugs and breakages when subclasses behave differently from their base classes. Adhering to LSP helps:\nEnsure Consistency: Subclasses are expected to behave consistently with their base classes. Maintain Predictability: LSP allows for predictable behavior, so consumers of the base class don’t need to know about subclass-specific details. Enhance Code Reusability: By ensuring that subclasses don’t violate the expectations of their base classes, we promote reusable code that’s easier to extend. Key Concepts of LSP # Behavioral Consistency: Subclasses should not change the expected behavior of methods inherited from the base class. Subtype Polymorphism: LSP enables polymorphism by ensuring that subclasses can be used interchangeably with their base class. No Weakened Preconditions or Strengthened Postconditions: Subclasses should not impose stricter conditions than the base class (preconditions) or give stronger guarantees on the result (postconditions). LSP in Action # Let’s explore an example to see how LSP works and what happens when it’s violated.\nWithout LSP: Violation Example # Consider a Rectangle class with width and height properties, and a Square subclass that inherits from it.\nclass Rectangle { protected int width; protected int height; public void setWidth(int width) { this.width = width; } public void setHeight(int height) { this.height = height; } public int getArea() { return width * height; } } class Square extends Rectangle { @Override public void setWidth(int width) { this.width = width; this.height = width; // Square has equal width and height } @Override public void setHeight(int height) { this.height = height; this.width = height; // Square has equal width and height } } In this example:\nThe Square class overrides setWidth and setHeight to ensure that the width and height remain equal, as squares require. However, this breaks the expected behavior of the Rectangle class. For example, if a function expects a Rectangle but is passed a Square, setting only the width or height will produce incorrect results. public void resizeRectangle(Rectangle rectangle) { rectangle.setWidth(5); rectangle.setHeight(10); assert rectangle.getArea() == 50; // This fails for Square } In this case, using Square in place of Rectangle causes unexpected behavior, violating LSP.\nWith LSP: Corrected Example # To satisfy LSP, we should avoid making Square a subclass of Rectangle because a square is not a type of rectangle in terms of the expected behavior of width and height properties. Instead, we can create separate classes that share a common interface.\ninterface Shape { int getArea(); } class Rectangle implements Shape { protected int width; protected int height; public Rectangle(int width, int height) { this.width = width; this.height = height; } public int getArea() { return width * height; } } class Square implements Shape { private int side; public Square(int side) { this.side = side; } public int getArea() { return side * side; } } Now:\nRectangle and Square implement a common Shape interface, rather than Square inheriting from Rectangle. Both classes provide an getArea method, so either can be used interchangeably where a Shape is expected. This approach avoids violating LSP, as the behavior of Square and Rectangle no longer conflict. LSP in Real-World Applications # Let’s consider a practical scenario involving document processing.\nSuppose we have a base class Document with a method print and a derived class ReadOnlyDocument that represents read-only documents.\nclass Document { public void print() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Printing document...\u0026#34;); } public void save() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Saving document...\u0026#34;); } } class ReadOnlyDocument extends Document { @Override public void save() { throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\u0026#34;Cannot save a read-only document\u0026#34;); } } In this example:\nReadOnlyDocument violates LSP because it changes the expected behavior of the save method. If a function that processes Document objects tries to save a ReadOnlyDocument, it will encounter an exception. Solution # To fix this, we can refactor by separating the behavior using interfaces.\ninterface Printable { void print(); } interface Saveable { void save(); } class EditableDocument implements Printable, Saveable { public void print() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Printing document...\u0026#34;); } public void save() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Saving document...\u0026#34;); } } class ReadOnlyDocument implements Printable { public void print() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Printing read-only document...\u0026#34;); } } This approach ensures that ReadOnlyDocument and EditableDocument conform to LSP, as each class now has methods that are specific to its functionality.\nBenefits and Challenges of LSP # Benefits # Improved Predictability: Clients can use subclasses without needing to know their specific details, as behavior is consistent across the hierarchy. Enhanced Code Reusability: By following LSP, subclasses can be seamlessly reused where base classes are expected. Reduced Bugs: Violations of LSP can introduce subtle bugs, so adherence to LSP reduces the likelihood of unexpected behavior. Challenges # Complex Hierarchies: LSP can be challenging in complex hierarchies where subclass-specific behaviors conflict with base class expectations. Increased Design Overhead: LSP requires careful planning of class hierarchies and interfaces, which can add complexity to the design phase. Potential for Over-Refactoring: Strict adherence to LSP can sometimes lead to over-refactoring, where the desire for compliance introduces excessive interfaces or classes. Best Practices for Implementing LSP # Test Substitutability: Regularly test that subclasses can replace base classes without changing behavior, especially if the base class has defined contracts or invariants. Favor Composition Over Inheritance: Where LSP is difficult to achieve, consider using composition rather than inheritance to share functionality without inheriting unwanted behavior. Avoid Overloading Subclass Responsibilities: Limit the responsibilities of subclasses to avoid conflicts with base class expectations. Conclusion # The Liskov Substitution Principle is essential for creating robust, extendable, and reusable class hierarchies. By adhering to LSP, we ensure that subclasses behave in a way that is consistent with their base classes, allowing for predictable and interchangeable code. Though it may require extra design considerations, LSP ultimately leads to software that is more flexible, maintainable, and less prone to errors.\n"},{"id":22,"href":"/docs/design-patterns/mediator/","title":"Mediator Pattern","section":"Design Patterns","content":" Mediator Pattern # The Mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that promotes loose coupling between objects by encapsulating their communication within a mediator. The mediator centralizes interactions between objects, making them easier to modify and reuse independently.\nIntent # The main intent of the Mediator pattern is to reduce dependencies between communicating objects by introducing a mediator that handles their interactions. This pattern is especially useful in scenarios where multiple objects need to communicate, and direct coupling would create a complex web of dependencies.\nProblem and Solution # Problem # Suppose you’re designing a chat application where multiple users can send messages to each other. Without a centralized way to manage communication, each user would need to be aware of all other users, resulting in tightly coupled code that is difficult to maintain and extend. Adding new users or changing communication behavior would require modifying all related classes.\nSolution # The Mediator pattern solves this problem by creating a mediator object (e.g., ChatRoom) that manages the communication between users. Each user communicates only with the mediator, which then relays messages to the appropriate recipients. This setup decouples users from each other, making the system easier to maintain, modify, and extend.\nStructure # The Mediator pattern typically includes:\nMediator Interface: Defines methods for communication between colleagues. Concrete Mediator: Implements the mediator interface, coordinating interactions between colleagues. Colleague Interface: Defines a common interface for all participants that communicate through the mediator.

We’ll create a ChatRoom mediator to handle communication between users, allowing them to send messages to each other without being directly aware of one another.\nStep 1: Define the Mediator Interface # The ChatMediator interface defines a method for sending messages. The mediator will coordinate message delivery between users.\n// Mediator Interface interface ChatMediator { void sendMessage(String message, User user); } Step 2: Implement the Concrete Mediator # The ChatRoom class implements the ChatMediator interface, managing a list of users and relaying messages between them.\n// Concrete Mediator class ChatRoom implements ChatMediator { private List\u0026lt;User\u0026gt; users = new ArrayList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); public void addUser(User user) { users.add(user); } @Override public void sendMessage(String message, User user) { for (User u : users) { if (u != user) { u.receive(message); } } } } Step 3: Define the Colleague Interface # The User class represents a participant in the chat.

Bob received: Hello, everyone! Charlie received: Hello, everyone! Bob sends: Hi, Alice! Alice received: Hi, Alice! Charlie received: Hi, Alice! In this example:\nThe ChatRoom mediator handles communication between users, with each user sending and receiving messages only through the mediator. ConcreteUser represents a user in the chat, sending and receiving messages through the ChatRoom. The client code interacts with the users through the mediator, which manages all message delivery. Applicability # Use the Mediator pattern when:\nYou need to reduce coupling between multiple classes that communicate with each other. You want to simplify complex communication patterns or workflows by centralizing interactions. You need flexibility to modify communication between objects without modifying the objects themselves. Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Reduces Coupling: The Mediator pattern reduces direct dependencies between objects, promoting loose coupling and improving maintainability. Centralized Control: By managing interactions in one place, the mediator simplifies complex communication and makes it easier to understand and modify. Enhanced Flexibility: New colleagues can be added or removed easily, and communication behavior can be changed by modifying the mediator. Disadvantages # Increased Complexity in the Mediator: As more communication logic is centralized, the mediator can become complex, potentially turning into a “god object.” Potential Performance Bottleneck: Since all interactions go through the mediator, it can become a performance bottleneck, especially in high-traffic scenarios. Best Practices for Implementing the Mediator Pattern # Limit Mediator Complexity: Avoid turning the mediator into an overly complex object. If the mediator becomes too complex, consider splitting its responsibilities. Use Mediator to Manage High Interdependencies: Apply the Mediator pattern in systems where multiple objects interact frequently, as it simplifies managing these dependencies. Encapsulate Communication Patterns: Use the mediator to encapsulate communication patterns, making it easier to modify behavior without affecting the colleagues. Conclusion # The Mediator pattern provides a centralized way to manage communication between objects, reducing coupling and making the system easier to extend and maintain. By isolating communication logic, the Mediator pattern enhances flexibility and scalability in complex systems.\n"},{"id":23,"href":"/docs/design-patterns/memento/","title":"Memento Pattern","section":"Design Patterns","content":" Memento Pattern # The Memento pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to save and restore its state without exposing its internal structure. This pattern is particularly useful for implementing undo/redo functionality, as it captures an object’s state at a specific moment and allows it to be restored later.\nIntent # The main intent of the Memento pattern is to capture and externalize an object’s internal state so that it can be restored later without violating encapsulation. By storing snapshots of an object’s state, this pattern enables undo and redo operations, making it ideal for applications like text editors or graphical editors.\nProblem and Solution # Problem # Imagine a text editor where users can type text and use the undo function to revert to a previous state. Without a way to store and restore the state of the editor, implementing an undo function would be difficult, requiring complex logic to track every change.\nSolution # The Memento pattern solves this problem by capturing snapshots (mementos) of the editor’s state at specific points in time. When the user performs an undo, the editor can restore a previous state from its saved mementos. This design keeps the internal details of the editor hidden from external objects, adhering to the principle of encapsulation.\nStructure # The Memento pattern typically includes:\nOriginator: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored. Memento: A snapshot of the originator’s state, stored as an opaque object. Caretaker: Responsible for storing and managing mementos without accessing their contents.

The editor will save states after each edit and allow users to undo changes by restoring previous states.\nStep 1: Define the Memento Class # The Memento class holds a snapshot of the TextEditor’s state. This class is immutable, with no public methods to modify its contents.\n// Memento class Memento { private final String state; public Memento(String state) { this.state = state; } public String getState() { return state; } } Step 2: Implement the Originator # The TextEditor class acts as the originator, with methods to save and restore its state. It uses the Memento class to create snapshots and restore its state.\n// Originator class TextEditor { private String content; public void setContent(String content) { this.content = content; } public String getContent() { return content; } public Memento saveState() { return new Memento(content); } public void restoreState(Memento memento) { this.content = memento.getState(); } } Step 3: Implement the Caretaker # The History class acts as the caretaker, storing a list of mementos and managing the undo functionality.

How are you? After undo: Hello, World! After another undo: Hello In this example:\nTextEditor is the originator, capable of saving and restoring its state through mementos. Memento stores the state of TextEditor as an immutable snapshot. History acts as the caretaker, managing the list of mementos and enabling undo functionality by providing previous states when needed. Applicability # Use the Memento pattern when:\nYou want to provide undo or rollback functionality without exposing the internal structure of the object. You need to save snapshots of an object’s state, but the object’s internal details should remain hidden from other objects. The state to be saved is complex or changes frequently, making a centralized snapshot mechanism beneficial. Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Encapsulation of State: Memento captures and stores an object’s state while keeping it private and hidden from other objects. Supports Undo Functionality: The pattern provides a simple way to implement undo/redo features by storing previous states. Decouples State Management: By externalizing the saved state, Memento separates state management from the object’s main logic, keeping the code clean and organized. Disadvantages # Memory Usage: Storing multiple states can consume significant memory, especially for large objects or frequent snapshots. Increased Complexity: The Memento pattern introduces additional classes (memento and caretaker), which can add complexity to the system. Potential Privacy Issues: If the caretaker has too much access to mementos, it may lead to unintended exposure of an object’s state. Best Practices for Implementing the Memento Pattern # Limit Memento Access: Keep mementos immutable and avoid giving the caretaker or other objects direct access to internal state. Manage Memory Usage Carefully: Be mindful of the memory impact when saving multiple mementos, and consider limiting the number of saved states. Use with Complex State Changes: Apply this pattern when dealing with complex or frequently changing states that benefit from snapshot-based management. Conclusion # The Memento pattern provides an effective way to save and restore an object’s state, enabling functionality like undo/redo without compromising encapsulation. By externalizing snapshots, the Memento pattern allows flexible state management while preserving the internal details of the originator.\n"},{"id":24,"href":"/docs/design-patterns/observer/","title":"Observer Pattern","section":"Design Patterns","content":" Observer Pattern # The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many relationship between objects so that when one object’s state changes, all dependent objects are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is commonly used in event-driven programming, GUIs, and distributed event-handling systems.\nIntent # The main intent of the Observer pattern is to establish a relationship between objects where changes to one object (the subject) automatically propagate to all its dependents (observers). This pattern allows for a flexible, decoupled design where the subject and its observers can vary independently.\nProblem and Solution # Problem # Suppose you’re developing a weather station system that gathers weather data and displays it across multiple devices (e.g., phones, tablets, TVs). Without a way to automatically propagate updates to all devices, each device would need to constantly poll for changes, resulting in inefficient and tightly coupled code.\nSolution # The Observer pattern solves this problem by having the WeatherStation act as the subject and each device as an observer. Whenever the weather station updates, it notifies all registered devices (observers) of the change.

The WeatherStation is the subject that maintains weather data and notifies devices (observers) when the data changes.\nStep 1: Define the Observer Interface # The Observer interface defines the update method, which all observers must implement to receive updates.\n// Observer Interface interface Observer { void update(float temperature, float humidity); } Step 2: Implement the Subject # The WeatherStation class acts as the subject. It maintains a list of observers and notifies them when the weather data changes.\n// Subject class WeatherStation { private List\u0026lt;Observer\u0026gt; observers = new ArrayList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); private float temperature; private float humidity; public void attach(Observer observer) { observers.add(observer); } public void detach(Observer observer) { observers.remove(observer); } public void setWeatherData(float temperature, float humidity) { this.temperature = temperature; this.humidity = humidity; notifyObservers(); } private void notifyObservers() { for (Observer observer : observers) { observer.update(temperature, humidity); } } } Step 3: Implement Concrete Observers # Each device (e.g., PhoneDisplay, TVDisplay) acts as a concrete observer and implements the update method to respond to changes in weather data.\n// Concrete Observer for Phone Display class PhoneDisplay implements Observer { @Override public void update(float temperature, float humidity) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Phone Display: Temperature = \u0026#34; + temperature + \u0026#34;, Humidity = \u0026#34; + humidity); } } // Concrete Observer for TV Display class TVDisplay implements Observer { @Override public void update(float temperature, float humidity) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;TV Display: Temperature = \u0026#34; + temperature + \u0026#34;, Humidity = \u0026#34; + humidity); } } Step 4: Client Code Using the Observer Pattern # The client code creates a weather station and attaches various displays to it.

PhoneDisplay and TVDisplay are observers that respond to changes in the weather data by implementing the update method. The client code attaches observers to the weather station, allowing them to receive updates whenever the weather data changes. Applicability # Use the Observer pattern when:\nAn object needs to notify other objects without making assumptions about who or what those objects are. There is a need to create a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that changes in one object are automatically propagated to others. The set of objects that depend on the subject changes dynamically, and you want to allow for flexible addition or removal of observers. Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Loose Coupling: The Observer pattern promotes loose coupling by decoupling subjects from their observers, allowing them to vary independently. Easy Addition/Removal of Observers: Observers can be added or removed dynamically at runtime, providing flexibility in managing dependencies. Supports Event-Driven Architecture: This pattern is well-suited for event-driven systems, allowing objects to respond to changes in other objects automatically. Disadvantages # Potential Memory Leaks: Observers that are not detached may lead to memory leaks if they are no longer needed but still hold references to the subject. Unpredictable Execution Order: The order in which observers are notified is not guaranteed, which may lead to unexpected behavior in certain cases. Performance Overhead: If there are many observers or frequent notifications, the Observer pattern may introduce performance overhead. Best Practices for Implementing the Observer Pattern # Use Weak References to Avoid Memory Leaks: Consider using weak references or other techniques to avoid memory leaks when observers are no longer needed. Notify Observers Asynchronously if Necessary: If notifications may take time, consider notifying observers asynchronously to avoid blocking the main execution. Provide Detachment Mechanisms: Ensure that observers can be easily detached to allow for flexible management of observer lifecycles.

OCP is fundamental to creating systems that are easy to extend, reducing the need to modify existing, tested code and thereby decreasing the risk of introducing new bugs.\nWhy Use the Open-Closed Principle? # The Open-Closed Principle helps make systems more maintainable, scalable, and robust by:\nEncouraging Modularity: By keeping classes and modules closed for modification, OCP promotes a modular design where individual components have distinct responsibilities.

OCP in Action # Let’s look at an example to see how OCP can be applied effectively.\nWithout OCP: Hard-Coded Logic # Suppose we have a system that calculates discounts for different customer types. Without OCP, this might be implemented as follows:\nclass DiscountService { public double calculateDiscount(String customerType, double amount) { if (customerType.equals(\u0026#34;Regular\u0026#34;)) { return amount * 0.05; } else if (customerType.equals(\u0026#34;Premium\u0026#34;)) { return amount * 0.1; } else { return 0; } } } In this example:\nThe DiscountService class checks for specific customer types and applies different discounts accordingly. To add a new customer type (e.g., “VIP”), we would need to modify the DiscountService class, which violates OCP. With OCP: Extensible Design # To adhere to OCP, we can create an interface DiscountCalculator and have separate classes implement specific discount calculations. Now, DiscountService can work with any DiscountCalculator without modification.\n// Interface interface DiscountCalculator { double calculate(double amount); } // Concrete Implementations class RegularDiscount implements DiscountCalculator { public double calculate(double amount) { return amount * 0.05; } } class PremiumDiscount implements DiscountCalculator { public double calculate(double amount) { return amount * 0.1; } } class VipDiscount implements DiscountCalculator { public double calculate(double amount) { return amount * 0.15; } } // DiscountService using Dependency Injection class DiscountService { private DiscountCalculator discountCalculator; public DiscountService(DiscountCalculator discountCalculator) { this.discountCalculator = discountCalculator; } public double calculateDiscount(double amount) { return discountCalculator.calculate(amount); } } Now, if we need to add new customer types, we only need to create a new class implementing DiscountCalculator, without modifying DiscountService. This keeps the system open for extension and closed for modification.\nUsing OCP with the Strategy Pattern # The Strategy Pattern is a design pattern that aligns well with OCP, as it allows us to change an algorithm’s behavior at runtime without modifying the context class.\n// Define the strategy interface interface SortingStrategy { void sort(List\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; items); } // Concrete strategies implementing the interface class QuickSortStrategy implements SortingStrategy { public void sort(List\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; items) { // Perform quick sort } } class MergeSortStrategy implements SortingStrategy { public void sort(List\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; items) { // Perform merge sort } } // Context class class Sorter { private SortingStrategy strategy; public Sorter(SortingStrategy strategy) { this.strategy = strategy; } public void setStrategy(SortingStrategy strategy) { this.strategy = strategy; } public void sortItems(List\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; items) { strategy.sort(items); } } In this example, Sorter can dynamically change sorting strategies without modifying the Sorter class itself, adhering to OCP. Adding a new sorting algorithm requires only a new class that implements SortingStrategy.\nBenefits and Challenges of OCP # Benefits # Enhanced Flexibility: The system becomes more adaptable to new requirements, as new features can be added without changing existing code. Improved Maintainability: OCP reduces the need to modify existing code, minimizing the risk of introducing bugs in already tested components. Better Scalability: Code adhering to OCP scales more easily, as new functionality can be added with minimal impact on the overall system. Challenges # Initial Design Complexity: Following OCP requires careful design, as it may lead to an increase in the number of interfaces and classes. Overhead for Small Projects: For simple or small projects, adhering strictly to OCP may add unnecessary complexity. Balancing Modularity with Performance: Excessive modularization for the sake of OCP can sometimes lead to performance trade-offs, especially in systems with high complexity. Best Practices for Implementing OCP # Identify Variations Early: When designing a system, identify the parts likely to change, and create abstractions around those. Favor Composition over Inheritance: Use composition to allow flexibility without overloading inheritance hierarchies. Use Interfaces and Abstract Classes: Base classes and interfaces can be used to define extensible behaviors without requiring changes to the existing code. Utilize Design Patterns: Many design patterns (e.g., Strategy, Factory, Observer) support OCP by allowing functionality to be added without modifying existing classes. Conclusion # The Open-Closed Principle promotes a design that is both resilient to change and easy to extend. By creating systems that are open for extension but closed for modification, we achieve more robust, maintainable, and adaptable code. OCP helps software evolve over time with minimal disruption, making it easier to introduce new features, fix issues, and respond to changing requirements.\n"},{"id":26,"href":"/docs/design-patterns/prototype/","title":"Prototype Pattern","section":"Design Patterns","content":" Prototype Pattern # The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that enables object creation by cloning existing instances. Instead of creating new instances from scratch, the Prototype pattern allows objects to be duplicated, reducing the need to repeat expensive initialization processes. This pattern is ideal when object creation is costly, complex, or involves significant configuration.\nIntent # The main intent of the Prototype pattern is to specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, allowing new objects to be created by copying this prototype. This pattern helps reduce the overhead of creating new instances by cloning pre-configured objects.\nProblem and Solution # Problem # Imagine you’re developing a graphic editor where you need to create multiple shapes with similar properties (e.g., colors, dimensions, coordinates). Each shape requires configuration, which can be repetitive and resource-intensive if created from scratch each time.\nSolution # The Prototype pattern lets you define a prototype object (e.g., Circle, Rectangle) with pre-configured properties. New shapes can be created by cloning these prototypes, inheriting the configuration of the original and making adjustments as needed. This approach minimizes the need for repetitive configuration and reduces object creation overhead.\nStructure # The Prototype pattern typically includes:\nPrototype Interface: Declares a clone method for cloning objects. Concrete Prototypes: Classes implementing the prototype interface, providing their own cloning mechanisms. Client Code: Uses the prototype objects to create new instances by cloning.

Circle and Rectangle provide their own cloning mechanisms, creating copies with the same properties. The client can create new shapes by cloning the prototypes, making adjustments as necessary. Applicability # Use the Prototype pattern when:\nObject creation is resource-intensive, complex, or requires significant configuration. You want to avoid duplicating code to initialize objects with similar properties. You need to create new instances by copying existing instances rather than creating them from scratch. Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Reduced Overhead: Prototypes can be cloned rather than recreated from scratch, reducing initialization costs for complex objects. Easier Object Creation: Prototype cloning simplifies object creation when similar configurations are needed. Flexibility: New objects can be created dynamically by cloning prototypes, providing flexibility without modifying the underlying code. Disadvantages # Deep vs. Shallow Copying: Cloning may require deep copying if the object contains references to mutable objects, which can increase complexity. Complex Cloning Logic: For objects with complex structures, implementing a reliable clone method can be challenging. Limited Use Case: Prototype is not suitable for objects that are simple or where instantiation from scratch is straightforward. Best Practices for Implementing the Prototype Pattern # Consider Deep Cloning: For objects with nested structures, ensure that deep copies are made to avoid shared references. Use clone Carefully: In Java, the clone method from Object can lead to issues if not properly implemented. Consider custom clone methods or use external libraries when necessary. Avoid Overusing: The Prototype pattern is best suited for scenarios where object creation is costly or complex; for simpler cases, regular instantiation is sufficient. Conclusion # The Prototype pattern provides a way to create new objects by duplicating existing instances, making it ideal for scenarios where objects require costly or complex configuration. By cloning prototypes, you can reduce object creation overhead and simplify the construction process, leading to cleaner and more flexible code.\n"},{"id":27,"href":"/docs/design-patterns/proxy/","title":"Proxy Pattern","section":"Design Patterns","content":" Proxy Pattern # The Proxy pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object. By controlling access to the underlying object, the Proxy pattern allows additional functionality, such as lazy initialization, access control, logging, or caching, to be added without modifying the original object.\nIntent # The main intent of the Proxy pattern is to control access to an object by acting as a stand-in for it, allowing additional functionality to be added transparently. This pattern is particularly useful when working with resource-intensive objects, objects that need controlled access, or objects that need enhanced functionality.\nProblem and Solution # Problem # Suppose you’re building an image viewer that can display high-resolution images from a remote server. Loading every image in full resolution at once can be slow and resource-intensive. Without a mechanism to manage the loading process, the application might become sluggish or unresponsive.\nSolution # The Proxy pattern can address this by creating an ImageProxy class that stands in for the actual image. The ImageProxy can handle loading the image only when it’s actually needed (lazy loading), making the application more responsive. Once loaded, the proxy forwards requests to the real image, making the process seamless to the client.\nStructure # The Proxy pattern typically includes:\nSubject: Defines the common interface for both the Real Subject and the Proxy. Real Subject: The actual object that performs the work and to which access is controlled. Proxy: Controls access to the Real Subject and may add additional functionality before or after forwarding requests to it.

We’ll create an ImageProxy that controls access to the high-resolution RealImage object, loading it only when necessary.\nStep 1: Define the Subject Interface # The Image interface defines the display method that both the real image and the proxy must implement.\n// Subject Interface interface Image { void display(); } Step 2: Implement the Real Subject # The RealImage class represents a high-resolution image that takes time and resources to load.\n// Real Subject class RealImage implements Image { private String filename; public RealImage(String filename) { this.filename = filename; loadImageFromDisk(); } private void loadImageFromDisk() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Loading image from disk: \u0026#34; + filename); } @Override public void display() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Displaying image: \u0026#34; + filename); } } Step 3: Implement the Proxy # The ImageProxy class controls access to the RealImage, only loading it when the display method is called for the first time.\n// Proxy class ImageProxy implements Image { private RealImage realImage; private String filename; public ImageProxy(String filename) { this.filename = filename; } @Override public void display() { if (realImage == null) { realImage = new RealImage(filename); // Load only when needed } realImage.display(); } } Step 4: Client Code Using the Proxy # The client interacts with ImageProxy just as it would with RealImage, without knowing if the image has been loaded yet.\npublic class Client { public static void main(String[] args) { Image image1 = new ImageProxy(\u0026#34;high_res_image1.jpg\u0026#34;); Image image2 = new ImageProxy(\u0026#34;high_res_image2.jpg\u0026#34;); // The image is loaded only when display() is called for the first time System.out.println(\u0026#34;Displaying images:\u0026#34;); image1.display(); // Loads and displays high_res_image1.jpg image1.display(); // Displays high_res_image1.jpg without loading again image2.display(); // Loads and displays high_res_image2.jpg } } Output # Displaying images: Loading image from disk: high_res_image1.jpg Displaying image: high_res_image1.jpg Displaying image: high_res_image1.jpg Loading image from disk: high_res_image2.jpg Displaying image: high_res_image2.jpg In this example:\nRealImage is the resource-intensive object that loads an image from disk. ImageProxy controls access to RealImage, only creating it when display is called for the first time (lazy loading). The client interacts with ImageProxy, which behaves like RealImage and loads the image only when necessary. Types of Proxy # The Proxy pattern can be implemented in different ways, depending on the additional functionality needed:\nVirtual Proxy: Manages access to a resource-intensive object by creating it only when necessary (e.g., lazy loading). Remote Proxy: Manages interaction with an object located on a remote server, handling communication details. Protection Proxy: Controls access to an object by enforcing permissions or authentication checks. Cache Proxy: Provides temporary storage to improve performance by caching responses from a resource-intensive or remote object. Applicability # Use the Proxy pattern when:\nYou need to control access to a resource-intensive or remote object. You want to add additional functionality, such as lazy loading, caching, or access control, to an object without modifying it. You want to separate concerns in your code, allowing a proxy to manage specific tasks independently of the real subject. Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Controlled Access: Proxy allows controlled access to the real subject, enhancing security, performance, or resource management. Lazy Initialization: The pattern supports lazy loading, reducing resource usage by delaying object creation until necessary. Decoupling: Proxy separates client code from specific functionalities (e.g., caching, loading), making the system more modular and maintainable. Disadvantages # Increased Complexity: Proxy introduces additional layers, which may increase code complexity. Potential Performance Overhead: Depending on implementation, proxies can add some latency, especially if multiple layers are involved. May Lead to Over-Engineering: Proxy should be used judiciously, as adding unnecessary proxies can lead to a complex and difficult-to-understand codebase. Best Practices for Implementing the Proxy Pattern # Identify Core Functionality and Additional Concerns: Use Proxy to separate additional concerns like security, caching, or logging from the main functionality. Use Lazy Loading and Caching Carefully: Ensure that lazy loading and caching improve performance without introducing excessive delays or stale data. Keep Proxy Interface Consistent: Maintain consistency between the Proxy and Real Subject interfaces to avoid confusion and unexpected behavior. Conclusion # The Proxy pattern provides a flexible way to control access to objects, allowing you to add functionality such as lazy loading, caching, or access control transparently. This pattern enhances modularity and performance in systems with resource-intensive, remote, or protected objects.\n"},{"id":28,"href":"/docs/coding-principles/solid/single-responsibility/","title":"Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)","section":"Coding Principles","content":" Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) # The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is the first principle in the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states:\n“A class should have only one reason to change.”\nIn other words, each class should focus on a single task or responsibility, ensuring that its functionality is cohesive and that it has a specific, well-defined purpose. Following SRP helps avoid tightly coupled code and makes systems easier to maintain, extend, and test.\nWhy Use the Single Responsibility Principle? # The Single Responsibility Principle promotes code that is modular, focused, and easier to understand. When each class has only one responsibility:\nEasier Maintenance: Changes in a class are isolated to its responsibility, reducing the risk of unexpected side effects. Improved Testability: Small, focused classes are easier to test, as their behavior is predictable and limited to a specific purpose. Increased Reusability: Classes with single responsibilities are more reusable, as they don’t carry unnecessary dependencies or behaviors. Key Concepts of SRP # Single Responsibility: Each class should have one main function or role. Reasons to Change: A class should only change for one reason related to its responsibility, making changes more predictable and controlled. Separation of Concerns: SRP aligns with the broader software design principle of separating concerns, where each component addresses only a distinct part of the functionality. SRP in Action # Let’s explore an example to see how SRP can improve design and avoid problems.\nWithout SRP: Multiple Responsibilities in a Single Class # Consider a User class that handles both user data and user persistence logic (saving to a database):\nclass User { private String name; private String email; public User(String name, String email) { this.name = name; this.email = email; } public void saveToDatabase() { // Code to save user to the database System.out.println(\u0026#34;Saving user to database\u0026#34;); } } In this example:\nThe User class has two responsibilities: it manages user data and handles database persistence. If the database structure or persistence logic changes, we’ll need to modify the User class, which should ideally be focused solely on user data. This design violates SRP because a change in either user data or database handling affects this class. With SRP: Separation of Responsibilities # To adhere to SRP, we can separate data management and persistence responsibilities into two distinct classes. The User class will now focus only on representing user data, while a UserRepository class will handle the persistence logic.\n// User class representing user data class User { private String name; private String email; public User(String name, String email) { this.name = name; this.email = email; } // Getters and other methods for user data } // UserRepository class handling database persistence class UserRepository { public void save(User user) { // Code to save user to the database System.out.println(\u0026#34;Saving user to database\u0026#34;); } } In this refactored design:\nThe User class now has a single responsibility: managing user data. The UserRepository class is responsible for database operations, allowing us to change the database logic independently of the User class. This separation adheres to SRP, making the code more modular, easier to maintain, and more testable. SRP in Layered Architectures # In layered architectures, SRP is often applied by separating different concerns into layers (e.g., presentation, business, data access). This way, each layer has a distinct role, and changes in one layer don’t directly impact others.\nFor example, in a web application:\nController (Presentation Layer): Handles user input and presentation logic. Service (Business Layer): Contains business logic. Repository (Data Access Layer): Manages database operations. // Controller handling user input class UserController { private UserService userService; public UserController(UserService userService) { this.userService = userService; } public void registerUser(String name, String email) { userService.createUser(name, email); } } // Service with business logic class UserService { private UserRepository userRepository; public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) { this.userRepository = userRepository; } public void createUser(String name, String email) { User user = new User(name, email); userRepository.save(user); } } // Repository handling database operations class UserRepository { public void save(User user) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Saving user to database\u0026#34;); } } This approach maintains SRP across layers, where each component has a specific, isolated responsibility.\nBenefits and Challenges of SRP # Benefits # Improved Code Quality: SRP promotes smaller, focused classes that are easier to read and maintain. Greater Flexibility: Changes in one part of the system are isolated, reducing the risk of breaking unrelated code. Easier Testing: Small, single-purpose classes are simpler to test in isolation, improving code reliability. Challenges # Over-Fragmentation: Over-applying SRP can lead to too many small classes, making the code harder to navigate and understand. Increased Complexity: For small projects, strict adherence to SRP may add unnecessary layers and complexity. Design Trade-offs: Deciding the exact responsibility of a class can be subjective and requires thoughtful design to balance modularity with simplicity. Best Practices for Implementing SRP # Identify Core Responsibilities Early: Before coding, identify the main purpose of each class to avoid adding unrelated logic. Separate Data from Behavior: Where appropriate, separate data representation from logic (e.g., using separate classes for data and services). Apply SRP Gradually: Start by applying SRP to larger, complex classes and refactor as needed. Not every small class requires strict SRP adherence initially. Conclusion # The Single Responsibility Principle is fundamental to creating a maintainable, modular codebase. By ensuring that each class has only one reason to change, SRP helps keep code focused, predictable, and easy to extend. While it may sometimes require extra classes or layers, SRP ultimately leads to a more robust and adaptable software design.\n"},{"id":29,"href":"/docs/design-patterns/singleton/","title":"Singleton Pattern","section":"Design Patterns","content":" Singleton Pattern # The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one \u0026ldquo;single\u0026rdquo; instance.

This pattern ensures controlled access to resources that must be shared throughout the application.\nProblem and Solution # Problem # Consider a logging class that writes messages to a file. If multiple instances of this logging class are created, they could interfere with each other by writing to the file simultaneously, resulting in conflicts or corrupted data. Therefore, only a single instance should be responsible for logging to ensure consistent access and control.\nSolution # The Singleton pattern addresses this problem by:\nRestricting the class to have only one instance. Providing a static method that returns this single instance, ensuring all parts of the application use the same instance. Structure # The Singleton pattern typically includes:\nPrivate Constructor: Prevents other classes from instantiating the Singleton class directly.

Connected to database. Connected to database. Both connections are the same: true In this example:\nThe first call to getInstance initializes the DatabaseConnection instance. Subsequent calls return the same instance, ensuring that only one connection object exists. The connect method demonstrates shared access to the same instance across different parts of the application. Thread-Safe Singleton (Advanced) # In a multithreaded environment, multiple threads could simultaneously call getInstance, creating multiple instances.

Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Controlled Access: Singleton provides controlled access to a single instance, simplifying resource management. Consistent State: A single instance ensures consistent state across the application, making it easier to manage. Global Access: Singleton provides a global point of access, which can be useful for centralized configurations or shared resources. Disadvantages # Hidden Dependencies: The Singleton pattern introduces global state, which can make code harder to test and debug. Reduced Flexibility: Singletons are difficult to subclass or extend due to their restrictive nature. Potential for Overuse: Overusing Singletons can lead to tightly coupled code and hidden dependencies, which can reduce modularity. Best Practices for Implementing the Singleton Pattern # Ensure Thread Safety: In multithreaded applications, use synchronization or an alternative like the Bill Pugh approach to ensure thread safety.

The document’s behavior changes dynamically based on its current state.\npublic class Client { public static void main(String[] args) { Document document = new Document(); // Initial state: Draft document.edit(); // Output: Editing the draft document. document.publish(); // Output: Moving document to moderation. // State changed to Moderation document.edit(); // Output: Cannot edit document in moderation. document.publish(); // Output: Publishing document. // State changed to Published document.edit(); // Output: Cannot edit document once published. document.publish(); // Output: Document is already published. } } Output # Editing the draft document. Moving document to moderation. Cannot edit document in moderation. Publishing document. Cannot edit document once published. Document is already published. In this example:\nThe Document class is the context, maintaining the current state and delegating behavior to it. DraftState, ModerationState, and PublishedState are concrete states that implement state-specific behavior. The client code interacts with Document, and its behavior changes dynamically based on the current state. Applicability # Use the State pattern when:\nAn object’s behavior depends on its state, and it needs to change behavior dynamically based on that state. You have a complex conditional structure that determines the behavior of an object based on multiple states. You want to make it easier to add or modify states without changing the context or adding complex conditionals. Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Simplifies Code Structure: The State pattern eliminates complex conditional logic by organizing behavior into state-specific classes. Promotes Single Responsibility: Each state class focuses on specific behavior, making the code modular and easier to maintain. Easily Extensible: New states can be added without modifying the context, following the Open-Closed Principle. Disadvantages # Increased Class Count: The pattern can lead to an increased number of classes, especially if there are many states. Potential Overhead: For simple state transitions, the State pattern may add unnecessary complexity and overhead. Requires Careful State Management: Incorrect handling of transitions can lead to unexpected behavior. Best Practices for Implementing the State Pattern # Use the State Pattern for Complex Behavior: The pattern is most effective when an object has complex state-dependent behavior. Avoid using it for simple cases with only a few state transitions. Encapsulate Transition Logic in States: Allow state objects to manage transitions to other states to keep the context clean and focused on delegation. Apply When Modularity Is Required: The State pattern promotes modularity, making it easier to manage and extend complex state-based behavior. Conclusion # The State pattern provides a flexible way to handle state-dependent behavior by encapsulating state-specific behavior in separate classes. This approach simplifies code by eliminating conditionals and enhances extensibility by allowing new states to be added without modifying the context.\n"},{"id":31,"href":"/docs/design-patterns/strategy/","title":"Strategy Pattern","section":"Design Patterns","content":" Strategy Pattern # The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each algorithm, and make them interchangeable.

Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Promotes Open-Closed Principle: New strategies can be added without modifying the existing context, making the code extensible and maintainable. Eliminates Conditional Logic: The pattern reduces the need for conditional statements by encapsulating algorithms in separate classes. Easily Interchangeable Algorithms: Strategies can be swapped dynamically, providing flexible control over behavior. Disadvantages # Increased Number of Classes: The Strategy pattern requires creating a separate class for each algorithm, which can lead to more classes in the codebase. Context Awareness: The context must be aware of available strategies, requiring clients to understand the strategies and choose appropriately. Potential Overhead: In some cases, the added flexibility of strategies may introduce overhead, especially if the strategies are simple and rarely change. Best Practices for Implementing the Strategy Pattern # Choose the Pattern for Complex Algorithms: The Strategy pattern is most beneficial for complex algorithms that are likely to vary. Avoid using it for simple behaviors. Encapsulate Variants Carefully: Ensure that each strategy encapsulates a specific behavior or algorithm to maintain modularity and simplicity. Provide a Default Strategy: In some cases, consider providing a default strategy to handle cases where the client does not specify one. Conclusion # The Strategy pattern provides a clean way to define and swap algorithms dynamically, allowing clients to choose behavior at runtime.

This pattern helps enforce consistency in the algorithm’s structure while still allowing flexibility in individual steps.\nProblem and Solution # Problem # Suppose you’re building a document generation system that produces reports in different formats (e.g., PDF, HTML, and CSV). Each format has a unique way of presenting data, but the general structure of generating a report is the same: gather data, format it, and export it. Without a way to define the common structure in one place, each report format would need to duplicate parts of the algorithm, making the system harder to maintain.\nSolution # The Template Method pattern addresses this problem by defining the general structure of the report generation algorithm in a superclass, with customizable steps for each format (e.g., formatting and exporting).

Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Promotes Code Reuse: The Template Method pattern centralizes the common steps of an algorithm, promoting reuse and reducing redundancy. Ensures Consistent Workflow: The template method enforces a consistent structure for the algorithm, making the process predictable and maintainable. Easy to Extend: New subclasses can define custom behavior for specific steps without changing the core algorithm. Disadvantages # Increased Number of Classes: The pattern requires creating a subclass for each specific behavior, which can increase the number of classes. Potentially Inflexible: Since the template method is defined in the abstract class, any changes to the algorithm’s structure require modifications to the superclass, impacting all subclasses. Best Practices for Implementing the Template Method Pattern # Encapsulate Invariant Behavior: Use the Template Method pattern to encapsulate the steps of an algorithm that are invariant across subclasses, centralizing them in the base class. Limit the Template Method’s Scope: Avoid making the template method overly complex. Define only the essential steps, and leave details to the subclasses. Use Hook Methods (Optional): Consider adding optional steps (hooks) in the template method that subclasses can override if needed. This approach provides more flexibility.

This pattern enables you to define operations that can be applied to various objects in a class hierarchy, decoupling the operations from the objects they operate on.\nIntent # The main intent of the Visitor pattern is to separate an algorithm from the object structure on which it operates, enabling new operations to be added without modifying the structure. This pattern is useful for extending functionality without changing the underlying classes, adhering to the Open-Closed Principle.\nProblem and Solution # Problem # Imagine a tax application that calculates taxes on different types of assets, such as stocks, real estate, and bonds. Each asset has unique tax rules, and adding or modifying tax calculations can become complex, especially if they are tightly coupled to each asset class. Without the Visitor pattern, you would need to alter each asset class whenever a new tax rule is added, leading to a less flexible design.\nSolution # The Visitor pattern addresses this by placing tax calculations in a separate visitor class. Each asset accepts the visitor, which then performs the appropriate tax calculations. This approach allows for easy addition of new calculations without modifying the asset classes, making it simple to extend functionality.\nStructure # The Visitor pattern typically includes:\nVisitor Interface: Declares a visit method for each type of concrete element in the structure. Concrete Visitor: Implements specific operations to perform on each type of element. Element Interface: Defines an accept method to allow visitors to operate on the element.

We’ll create different asset types (e.g., Stock, RealEstate) and a visitor for tax calculation. Each asset accepts the visitor to perform tax calculations without knowing the specific tax logic.\nStep 1: Define the Visitor Interface # The Visitor interface declares visit methods for each concrete element type (i.e., Stock, RealEstate), enabling the visitor to perform specific operations.\n// Visitor Interface interface Visitor { void visit(Stock stock); void visit(RealEstate realEstate); } Step 2: Implement Concrete Visitor # The TaxCalculator class is a concrete visitor that implements tax calculation for each type of asset.\n// Concrete Visitor for Tax Calculation class TaxCalculator implements Visitor { @Override public void visit(Stock stock) { double tax = stock.getValue() * 0.15; // Assume 15% tax on stocks System.out.println(\u0026#34;Tax on stock: $\u0026#34; + tax); } @Override public void visit(RealEstate realEstate) { double tax = realEstate.getValue() * 0.1; // Assume 10% tax on real estate System.out.println(\u0026#34;Tax on real estate: $\u0026#34; + tax); } } Step 3: Define the Element Interface # The Asset interface defines an accept method, allowing the visitor to operate on it.\n// Element Interface interface Asset { void accept(Visitor visitor); } Step 4: Implement Concrete Elements # Each concrete asset (e.g., Stock, RealEstate) implements the accept method, which calls the corresponding visit method on the visitor.\n// Concrete Element for Stock class Stock implements Asset { private double value; public Stock(double value) { this.value = value; } public double getValue() { return value; } @Override public void accept(Visitor visitor) { visitor.visit(this); } } // Concrete Element for Real Estate class RealEstate implements Asset { private double value; public RealEstate(double value) { this.value = value; } public double getValue() { return value; } @Override public void accept(Visitor visitor) { visitor.visit(this); } } Step 5: Client Code Using the Visitor Pattern # The client code creates assets and applies the TaxCalculator visitor to each asset, calculating tax without modifying the asset classes.\npublic class Client { public static void main(String[] args) { Asset stock = new Stock(1000.0); Asset realEstate = new RealEstate(5000.0); Visitor taxCalculator = new TaxCalculator(); // Calculate tax for each asset stock.accept(taxCalculator); // Output: Tax on stock: $150.0 realEstate.accept(taxCalculator); // Output: Tax on real estate: $500.0 } } Output # Tax on stock: $150.0 Tax on real estate: $500.0 In this example:\nTaxCalculator is the visitor that calculates tax for each type of asset. Stock and RealEstate are concrete elements that implement the accept method. The client code applies TaxCalculator to each asset, calculating tax without modifying asset classes. Applicability # Use the Visitor pattern when:\nYou need to perform operations on a set of objects with varying types, and you want to keep the operations separate from the object structure. The object structure rarely changes, but you expect to add new operations frequently. You want to avoid modifying classes each time a new operation is required, maintaining adherence to the Open-Closed Principle. Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # Extensibility: The Visitor pattern makes it easy to add new operations without modifying the classes on which they operate. Separation of Concerns: Operations are separated from the object structure, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code. Open-Closed Principle: New functionality can be added without changing existing code, as operations are handled by visitors. Disadvantages # Increased Complexity: The pattern introduces multiple classes (visitors and elements), which may increase complexity. Dependency on Object Structure: The pattern relies on a stable object structure, as changes to the structure require updating all visitors. Not Ideal for Frequently Changing Structures: If the object structure changes frequently, the Visitor pattern can become cumbersome, as each visitor needs to account for the changes. Best Practices for Implementing the Visitor Pattern # Use When Object Structure Is Stable: The pattern is most effective when the object structure remains stable, allowing new operations to be added easily. Avoid If Structure Changes Frequently: If the structure changes often, consider alternative patterns that are less reliant on a stable hierarchy. Consider Double Dispatch: The Visitor pattern uses double dispatch to enable the correct visitor method to be called based on both the visitor and the element type. Conclusion # The Visitor pattern provides a powerful way to add operations to object structures without modifying the objects themselves. By decoupling operations from the object structure, the Visitor pattern supports open-ended extensibility, making it ideal for scenarios with stable structures but frequently changing operations.\n"}]
