Clean code is not just about making code work; it’s about making code readable, maintainable, and adaptable. Writing clean code allows for easier collaboration, faster debugging, and more robust applications. Below are some essential principles of clean code, along with examples and explanations.

## Meaningful Names
Choose variable, function, and class names that clearly indicate their purpose. Avoid abbreviations and single letters unless they are common conventions (e.g., `i` for a loop index).

### Example
```python
# Bad
def calc(x, y):
    return x + y

# Good
def calculate_total_price(price, tax):
    return price + tax
```

Using meaningful names improves code readability and minimizes the need for comments.

## Small Functions and Methods
Functions should do one thing and do it well. Keeping functions small and focused makes code easier to test, reuse, and debug.

### Example
```javascript
// Bad
function processOrder(order) {
    validate(order);
    calculatePrice(order);
    saveOrder(order);
    sendConfirmation(order);
}

// Good
function validateOrder(order) { /* ... */ }
function calculateOrderPrice(order) { /* ... */ }
function saveOrder(order) { /* ... */ }
function sendOrderConfirmation(order) { /* ... */ }
```

Each function has a single responsibility, making the code modular and easier to manage.

## Avoiding Magic Numbers and Strings
Avoid using hard-coded numbers or strings directly in your code. Instead, assign them to constants with meaningful names.

### Example
```java
// Bad
if (user.age > 18) { /* ... */ }

// Good
final int LEGAL_AGE = 18;
if (user.age > LEGAL_AGE) { /* ... */ }
```

This practice makes your code self-explanatory and simplifies updates if the value needs to change.

## Single Responsibility Principle
Each function, method, or class should have only one reason to change. Following this principle leads to better organized, modular code.

### Example
```ruby
# Bad
class UserAccount
  def create_account
    # ...
  end
  
  def send_welcome_email
    # ...
  end
end

# Good
class UserAccount
  def create_account
    # ...
  end
end

class EmailService
  def send_welcome_email
    # ...
  end
end
```

Separating responsibilities promotes code reuse and easier maintenance.

## Comment with Purpose
Comments should explain the "why" behind complex logic, not the "what." If the code is self-explanatory, additional comments may be unnecessary.

### Example
```csharp
// Bad
int age = 18; // setting age to 18

// Good
// Minimum age requirement for registration
int minimumAge = 18;
```

## Consistent Coding Style
Consistent formatting and naming conventions make code easier to read and navigate. Most languages have widely accepted conventions, so try to follow them or establish team guidelines.

## DRY Principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
Avoid duplicating code. Instead, encapsulate common logic in functions or methods. Duplication increases maintenance costs and introduces inconsistencies.

### Example
```php
// Bad
$discount = $price * 0.10;
$total = $price - $discount;

// Good
function calculateDiscount($price, $rate) {
    return $price * $rate;
}
$discount = calculateDiscount($price, 0.10);
$total = $price - $discount;
```

## Error Handling
Handle errors gracefully to prevent application crashes and improve the user experience. Make use of error codes, exceptions, and logging where appropriate.

### Example
```typescript
// Bad
function fetchData(url) {
    const response = fetch(url);
    return response.json();
}

// Good
async function fetchData(url) {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        return await response.json();
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
    }
}
```

## Write Tests
Testing is essential for clean code. Tests help catch bugs early and ensure that changes don’t break existing functionality.

### Example
```javascript
// Using a testing framework like Jest
test("calculateTotalPrice adds price and tax", () => {
    expect(calculateTotalPrice(100, 20)).toBe(120);
});
```

## Refactor Continuously
Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. Regular refactoring improves code quality and readability over time.
