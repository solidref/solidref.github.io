# Decorator Pattern

The **Decorator** pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to dynamically add responsibilities to objects by placing them inside "wrapper" objects that contain additional functionality. The Decorator pattern enables flexible and reusable code by providing an alternative to subclassing for extending behavior.

## Intent

**The main intent of the Decorator pattern is to add new functionality to an object dynamically without altering its structure or affecting other objects of the same class.** This pattern allows you to stack behaviors on objects in a way that is flexible and adheres to the Open-Closed Principle.

## Problem and Solution

### Problem
Suppose you have a `TextEditor` that displays text and can have multiple formatting options, such as bold, italic, and underline. If you use inheritance to implement each combination (e.g., `BoldTextEditor`, `BoldItalicTextEditor`, etc.), the number of classes grows rapidly, and the code becomes difficult to maintain.

### Solution
The Decorator pattern solves this problem by allowing you to "wrap" the `TextEditor` object with decorators that add specific functionalities. You can stack multiple decorators around a single object, enabling any combination of behaviors dynamically at runtime.

## Structure

The Decorator pattern typically includes:
1. **Component Interface**: Defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them dynamically.
2. **Concrete Component**: The original object to which new functionality is added.
3. **Decorator**: Abstract class that implements the component interface and contains a reference to a component.
4. **Concrete Decorators**: Subclasses of the decorator that add specific behaviors to the component.

## Example: Text Editor with Formatting

Let’s implement an example of a text editor using the Decorator pattern. We’ll have a basic `TextEditor` that can display plain text, and we’ll add decorators for different formatting options, such as bold and italic.

### Step 1: Define the Component Interface

The `Text` interface defines the `render` method that all text components and decorators must implement.

```java
// Component Interface
interface Text {
    String render();
}
```

### Step 2: Implement the Concrete Component

The `PlainText` class implements the `Text` interface and represents the base component that can display plain text.

```java
// Concrete Component
class PlainText implements Text {
    private String content;

    public PlainText(String content) {
        this.content = content;
    }

    @Override
    public String render() {
        return content;
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Create the Abstract Decorator

The `TextDecorator` class implements the `Text` interface and holds a reference to a `Text` object, allowing it to act as a wrapper.

```java
// Decorator
abstract class TextDecorator implements Text {
    protected Text text;

    public TextDecorator(Text text) {
        this.text = text;
    }

    @Override
    public String render() {
        return text.render();
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Implement Concrete Decorators

Each concrete decorator adds specific behavior to the `Text` object, such as bold or italic formatting.

```java
// Concrete Decorator for Bold Text
class BoldTextDecorator extends TextDecorator {
    public BoldTextDecorator(Text text) {
        super(text);
    }

    @Override
    public String render() {
        return "<b>" + text.render() + "</b>";
    }
}

// Concrete Decorator for Italic Text
class ItalicTextDecorator extends TextDecorator {
    public ItalicTextDecorator(Text text) {
        super(text);
    }

    @Override
    public String render() {
        return "<i>" + text.render() + "</i>";
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Client Code Using the Decorator

The client code can now create text with different combinations of decorators by wrapping the `PlainText` object with various decorators.

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Text plainText = new PlainText("Hello, World!");

        // Apply bold formatting
        Text boldText = new BoldTextDecorator(plainText);
        System.out.println(boldText.render()); // Output: <b>Hello, World!</b>

        // Apply italic formatting
        Text italicText = new ItalicTextDecorator(plainText);
        System.out.println(italicText.render()); // Output: <i>Hello, World!</i>

        // Apply both bold and italic formatting
        Text boldItalicText = new BoldTextDecorator(new ItalicTextDecorator(plainText));
        System.out.println(boldItalicText.render()); // Output: <b><i>Hello, World!</i></b>
    }
}
```

### Explanation
In this example:
- The `Text` interface defines the `render` method that all text objects and decorators implement.
- `PlainText` is the base component that displays plain text.
- `BoldTextDecorator` and `ItalicTextDecorator` are concrete decorators that add bold and italic formatting, respectively.
- The client can combine multiple decorators to create complex formatting dynamically.

## Applicability

Use the Decorator pattern when:
1. You need to add responsibilities to objects dynamically and flexibly.
2. You want to avoid subclassing, as it would lead to a large number of classes for every possible combination of behaviors.
3. You need to add different combinations of behaviors to objects without modifying the base class or the client code.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
1. **Flexible Behavior Extension**: Decorator allows you to add or remove behaviors at runtime without modifying the original object.
2. **Adheres to Open-Closed Principle**: New behaviors can be added by creating new decorators, rather than modifying existing classes.
3. **Combining Multiple Behaviors**: You can stack multiple decorators around an object to create complex behaviors dynamically.

### Disadvantages
1. **Increased Complexity**: The Decorator pattern introduces additional classes, which may increase complexity, especially when many decorators are combined.
2. **Hard to Debug**: Multiple layers of decorators can make it difficult to debug and trace the flow of execution.
3. **Order Sensitivity**: The order in which decorators are applied can impact the final behavior, requiring careful attention.

## Best Practices for Implementing the Decorator Pattern

1. **Use Composition Over Inheritance**: Decorators should wrap objects instead of extending them, making the pattern more flexible.
2. **Limit Decorator Stacking**: While multiple decorators can be stacked, avoid overuse, as this can lead to confusion and increased complexity.
3. **Use Naming Conventions**: Clear naming for decorators helps in understanding the chain of decorators applied to an object.

## Conclusion

The Decorator pattern provides a flexible and dynamic way to add behaviors to objects without modifying their structure. This pattern enables you to enhance the functionality of objects at runtime, creating a modular and extensible design that adheres to the Open-Closed Principle.
