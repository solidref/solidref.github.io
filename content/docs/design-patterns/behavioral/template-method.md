# Template Method Pattern

The **Template Method** pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the structure (or skeleton) of an algorithm in a superclass, allowing subclasses to implement or override specific steps of the algorithm without altering its overall structure. This pattern promotes reuse by centralizing the common parts of the algorithm and leaving the customizable steps to subclasses.

## Intent

**The main intent of the Template Method pattern is to define an algorithm’s structure in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses, which can override specific parts of the algorithm.** This pattern helps enforce consistency in the algorithm’s structure while still allowing flexibility in individual steps.

## Problem and Solution

### Problem
Suppose you’re building a document generation system that produces reports in different formats (e.g., PDF, HTML, and CSV). Each format has a unique way of presenting data, but the general structure of generating a report is the same: gather data, format it, and export it. Without a way to define the common structure in one place, each report format would need to duplicate parts of the algorithm, making the system harder to maintain.

### Solution
The Template Method pattern addresses this problem by defining the general structure of the report generation algorithm in a superclass, with customizable steps for each format (e.g., formatting and exporting). Each report format can override these steps as needed, enabling different formats without duplicating the core logic.

## Structure

The Template Method pattern typically includes:
1. **Abstract Class**: Defines the template method (the skeleton of the algorithm) and provides methods that subclasses can override.
2. **Template Method**: A method in the abstract class that defines the sequence of steps in the algorithm, calling other methods that subclasses can customize.
3. **Concrete Classes**: Implement or override specific steps of the algorithm.

## Example: Report Generation System

Let’s implement a report generation system using the Template Method pattern. We’ll create a base class `Report` that defines the steps for generating a report. Each specific report type (e.g., `PDFReport`, `HTMLReport`) can override certain steps while maintaining the overall structure.

### Step 1: Define the Abstract Class with the Template Method

The `Report` class defines the template method `generateReport`, which outlines the sequence of steps for generating a report. Each step can be customized by subclasses.

```java
// Abstract Class
abstract class Report {
    public final void generateReport() {
        gatherData();
        formatReport();
        exportReport();
    }

    protected abstract void gatherData();

    protected abstract void formatReport();

    protected abstract void exportReport();
}
```

### Step 2: Implement Concrete Classes

Each concrete report class overrides the specific steps of the algorithm to provide its unique behavior for formatting and exporting.

```java
// Concrete Class for PDF Report
class PDFReport extends Report {
    @Override
    protected void gatherData() {
        System.out.println("Gathering data for PDF report.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void formatReport() {
        System.out.println("Formatting report in PDF format.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void exportReport() {
        System.out.println("Exporting report as a PDF file.");
    }
}

// Concrete Class for HTML Report
class HTMLReport extends Report {
    @Override
    protected void gatherData() {
        System.out.println("Gathering data for HTML report.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void formatReport() {
        System.out.println("Formatting report in HTML format.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void exportReport() {
        System.out.println("Exporting report as an HTML file.");
    }
}

// Concrete Class for CSV Report
class CSVReport extends Report {
    @Override
    protected void gatherData() {
        System.out.println("Gathering data for CSV report.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void formatReport() {
        System.out.println("Formatting report in CSV format.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void exportReport() {
        System.out.println("Exporting report as a CSV file.");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Client Code Using the Template Method Pattern

The client code uses the `generateReport` method of each report type, which follows the same sequence of steps but customizes them as needed.

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Report pdfReport = new PDFReport();
        System.out.println("Generating PDF Report:");
        pdfReport.generateReport();

        Report htmlReport = new HTMLReport();
        System.out.println("\nGenerating HTML Report:");
        htmlReport.generateReport();

        Report csvReport = new CSVReport();
        System.out.println("\nGenerating CSV Report:");
        csvReport.generateReport();
    }
}
```

### Output

```plaintext
Generating PDF Report:
Gathering data for PDF report.
Formatting report in PDF format.
Exporting report as a PDF file.

Generating HTML Report:
Gathering data for HTML report.
Formatting report in HTML format.
Exporting report as an HTML file.

Generating CSV Report:
Gathering data for CSV report.
Formatting report in CSV format.
Exporting report as a CSV file.
```

In this example:
- `Report` defines the `generateReport` template method, outlining the steps for generating a report.
- `PDFReport`, `HTMLReport`, and `CSVReport` are concrete classes that override specific steps, allowing each report type to customize behavior as needed.
- The client code calls `generateReport` on each report, and the overall sequence of steps remains consistent.

## Applicability

Use the Template Method pattern when:
1. You want to define the skeleton of an algorithm in one place, with some steps left for subclasses to implement.
2. You have multiple classes that share a common structure but require different implementations for specific steps.
3. You want to enforce a consistent workflow or process across subclasses, with flexible customization.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
1. **Promotes Code Reuse**: The Template Method pattern centralizes the common steps of an algorithm, promoting reuse and reducing redundancy.
2. **Ensures Consistent Workflow**: The template method enforces a consistent structure for the algorithm, making the process predictable and maintainable.
3. **Easy to Extend**: New subclasses can define custom behavior for specific steps without changing the core algorithm.

### Disadvantages
1. **Increased Number of Classes**: The pattern requires creating a subclass for each specific behavior, which can increase the number of classes.
2. **Potentially Inflexible**: Since the template method is defined in the abstract class, any changes to the algorithm’s structure require modifications to the superclass, impacting all subclasses.

## Best Practices for Implementing the Template Method Pattern

1. **Encapsulate Invariant Behavior**: Use the Template Method pattern to encapsulate the steps of an algorithm that are invariant across subclasses, centralizing them in the base class.
2. **Limit the Template Method’s Scope**: Avoid making the template method overly complex. Define only the essential steps, and leave details to the subclasses.
3. **Use Hook Methods (Optional)**: Consider adding optional steps (hooks) in the template method that subclasses can override if needed. This approach provides more flexibility.

## Conclusion

The Template Method pattern provides an effective way to define a sequence of steps in an algorithm while allowing subclasses to customize specific parts. By centralizing the structure of the algorithm in a base class, this pattern promotes consistency and reduces duplication.
